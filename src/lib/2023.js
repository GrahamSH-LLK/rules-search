It’s a way of doing things that encourages high quality\nwork, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the\ncommunity. Gracious Professionalism is not clearly defined for a\nreason. It can and should mean different things to everyone. Some possible meanings of Gracious Professionalism\ninclude: •                 \ngracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win, •                 \ngracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their\nactions, •                 \nprofessionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by\nsociety to use that knowledge responsibly, and  •                 \ngracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner\npleasing to others and to themselves. In the context of FIRST, this means that all teams\nand participants should: •                 \nlearn to be strong competitors, but also treat one another with\nrespect and kindness in the process and •                 \navoid leaving anyone feeling as if they are excluded or\nunappreciated. Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and\ngenuinely blended. In the end, Gracious Professionalism is part of\npursuing a meaningful life. When professionals use knowledge in a gracious\nmanner and individuals act with integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and\nsociety benefits.  The FIRST spirit encourages doing high-quality, well-informed\nwork in a manner that leaves everyone feeling valued.

When wrapping a taut string around this\nchassis, the string extends across the gap and the resulting Frame Perimeter is a triangle with 3 sides.\n\nFigure 9‑1 FRAME PERIMETER example\n\n\n\n"},"R102":{"name":"R102","type":"rule","text":"<p class=\"RuleNumber-Robot-Evergreen\"><a name=\"_Ref54876798\"></a><a name=\"R102\"></a><b><span style=\"color:#3C7B3B\">R102<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span></span></b><span class=\"Headline-Evergreen\">*</span><span class=\"Headline-EvergreenGlossaryterm\">Starting Configuration</span><span class=\"Headline-Evergreen\"> – no overhang.</span><span class=\"Headline\"> </span>In\nthe <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Starting Configuration</span> (<a name=\"STARTINGCONFIGURATION\">the physical configuration in which a <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Robot</span> starts a <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Match</span></a>),\nno part of the <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Robot</span> shall extend outside the\nvertical projection of the <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Frame Perimeter</span>,\nwith the exception of its <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Bumpers</span> and minor\nprotrusions such as bolt heads, fastener ends, rivets, cable ties, etc.</p><div style=\"border:solid #0DBDD4 1.5pt;padding:0in 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;\nbackground:#BBE5ED;margin-left:.75in;margin-right:.75in\">\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;\nmargin-left:0in;background:#BBE5ED\"><span style=\"color:black\">If a <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Robot</span> is designed as intended and each side is pushed\nup against a vertical wall (in <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Starting Configuration</span>\nand with <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Bumpers</span> removed), only the <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Frame Perimeter</span> (or minor protrusions) will be in\ncontact with the wall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;\nmargin-left:0in;background:#BBE5ED\"><span style=\"color:black\">The allowance for\nminor protrusions in this rule is intended to allow protrusions that are both\nminor in extension from the <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Frame Perimeter</span> and\ncross-sectional area.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;\nmargin-left:0in;background:#BBE5ED\"><span style=\"color:black\">If a <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Robot</span> uses interchangeable <span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Mechanisms</span>\nper <a href=\"#I103\">I103</a>, Teams should be prepared to show compliance with this\nrule and <a href=\"#R105\">R105</a> in all configurations.</span></p>\n\n</div>","summary":"R102      \n*Starting Configuration – no overhang.

Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining FMV since\nthe purchased pieces can each be used in various configurations.\n\nExample 8: Vendor B sells a robotic arm assembly that a team\nwants to use. However, it costs $630 USD, so they cannot use it. The Vendor sells the “hand”, “wrist”, and “arm” as\nseparate assemblies, for $210 USD each. A team wishes to purchase the 3 items\nseparately, then reassemble them. This would not be legal, as they are really\nbuying and using the entire assembly, which has a Fair Market Value of $630\nUSD.\n\nExample 9: Vendor C sells a set of wheels or wheel modules that\nare often used in groups of 4. The wheels or modules can be used in other\nquantities or configurations. A team purchases 4 and uses them in the most\ncommon configuration. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining\nFMV, since the purchased pieces can be used in various configurations.\n\n"},"R302":{"name":"R302","type":"rule","text":"<p class=\"RuleNumber-Robot-Evergreen\"><a name=\"R302\"></a><b><span style=\"color:\n#3C7B3B\">R302<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span></span></b><span class=\"Headline-Evergreen\">*Custom parts, generally from\nthis year only.</span><span class=\"Headline\"> </span><a name=\"_Ref50390136\"><span class=\"GlossaryTerm\">Fabricated Items</span> created before Kickoff are not\npermitted.

Bumpers\nmust be constructed as follows (see Figure 9‑7):  A.     be backed\nby ¾ in. thick (nominal, ~19mm) by 5 in. ± ½ in. (~127 mm ± 12.7 mm) tall\nplywood, Oriented Strand Board (OSB) or solid wood (with the exception of\nbalsa). Small clearance pockets to accommodate minor protrusions permitted per R101 and/or holes needed to access or recess mounting hardware\nin the wood backing are permitted, as long as they do not significantly affect\nthe structural integrity of the Bumper. \n\n¾ in. plywood and\nOSB refer to items sold by Vendors as that\nmaterial and thickness, teams may not fabricate their own plywood or OSB. Other\nengineered woods such as Fiberboard or Particle Board are not likely to survive\nthe rigors of FIRST Robotics Competition\ngameplay and thus not permitted per A.\n\nNote: ¾ in.\nplywood is often marked according to the actual dimension (²³⁄₃₂”) not the nominal size. Plywood sold as ²³⁄₃₂” meets the requirements of A.\n\n B.     hard Bumper parts allowed per A, E, F, and G must\nnot extend more than 1 in. (~25 mm) beyond the Frame\nPerimeter (measured as shown in Figure 9‑5).  Figure\n9‑5 Hard parts of Bumper corners  C.     use a\nstacked pair of 2½ in. (~63 mm) round, petal, or hex “pool noodles” (solid or\nhollow) as the Bumper cushion material (see Figure 9‑7). All pool noodles used in a Bumper\nset (e.g. red set of Bumpers) may not be\nmodified (with the exception of cutting to length or cutting to facilitate\nmating pool noodles at the corners as required by R409) or\ndeformed and must be the same diameter, cross section, and density (e.g. all\nround hollow or all hex solid). Per R409 cushion material\nmay extend beyond the end of the plywood in order to fill a corner (see Figure 9‑8). To assist in applying the fabric covering, soft fasteners may be\nused to attach the pool noodles to the wood backing, so long as the cross\nsection in Figure 9‑7 is not significantly altered (e.g. tape compressing\nthe pool noodles).  \n\n“2½ in. (~63 mm)\npool noodles” are pool noodles either sold as 2½ in. (~63 mm) diameter or that\nmeasure between 2¼ in. (~57 mm) pool noodles and 2¾ in. (~70 mm) diameter. \n\nAll pool noodles\nused on a Robot must be the same in order to\nmaintain the desired interaction between Robots\nin the cases of Bumper-to-Bumper contact. Bumpers\ncontaining pool noodles of vastly different construction may cause a “ramp”\neffect when interacting with other Bumpers.\n\nMinor noodle\ncompression as a result of smoothing Bumper\nfabric or rounding a Frame Perimeter corner is\nnot considered deformed. Any compression beyond that, e.g. for the purposes of\nflattening the pool noodle, is deformation and a violation of C.\n\n D.    \nbe covered with a rugged, smooth cloth with no additional coating\napplied by the team except for BUMPER markings permitted per R405\n(multiple layers of cloth and seams are permitted if needed to accommodate R405 and/or R406, provided the cross\nsection in Figure 9‑7 is not significantly altered). \n\nSilk and bedding\nare not considered rugged cloths, however 1000D Cordura is. Tape (e.g. gaffer’s\ntape) matching the Bumper color is allowed to\npatch small holes on a temporary basis.\n\nIt is expected\nthat there may be multiple layers of cloth as fabric is folded to accommodate\nthe corners and seams of Bumpers.\n\n The cloth must completely enclose all exterior\nsurfaces of the wood and pool noodle material when the Bumper is installed on the Robot.\nThe fabric covering the Bumpers must be solid\nin color. E.      optionally\nuse metal angle, as shown in Figure 9‑7 or other fasteners (e.g. staples,\nscrews, adhesives, etc.) to clamp cloth. F.      optionally\nuse metal brackets (i.e. angle or sheet metal) or other fasteners (e.g.\nstaples, screws, adhesives, etc.) to attach Bumper\nsegments to each other (see Figure 9‑6). Figure\n9‑6 Example uses of brackets in Bumper\ncorners  G.     must\nattach to the Frame Perimeter of the Robot with a rigid fastening system to form a tight,\nrobust connection to the main structure/frame (e.g. not attached with\nhook-and-loop tape, tape, or cable ties). The attachment system must be\ndesigned to withstand vigorous game play. All removable fasteners (e.g. bolts, locking\npins, pip-pins, etc.) will be considered part of the Bumpers.
