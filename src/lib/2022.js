      "1.4          Gracious Professionalism®, a FIRST Credo 1.4          Gracious Professionalism®, a FIRST Credo Gracious Professionalism® is part of the\nethos of FIRST. It’s a way of doing things that encourages high quality\nwork, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the\ncommunity. Gracious Professionalism is not clearly defined for a\nreason. It can and should mean different things to everyone. Some possible meanings of Gracious Professionalism\ninclude: •                 \ngracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win, •                 \ngracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their\nactions, •                 \nprofessionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by society to\nuse that knowledge responsibly, and  •                 \ngracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner pleasing\nto others and to themselves. In the context of FIRST, this means that all teams\nand participants should: •                 \nlearn to be strong competitors, but also treat one another with respect\nand kindness in the process and •                 \navoid leaving anyone feeling as if they are excluded or unappreciated. Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and\ngenuinely blended. In the end, Gracious Professionalism is part of\npursuing a meaningful life. When professionals use knowledge in a gracious\nmanner and individuals act with integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and\nsociety benefits.  The FIRST spirit encourages doing high-quality,\nwell-informed work in a manner that leaves everyone feeling valued. Gracious\nProfessionalism seems to be a good descriptor for part of the ethos of FIRST.\nIt is part of what makes FIRST different and wonderful. - Dr. Woodie Flowers, (1943 – 2019)  Distinguished Advisor to FIRST It is a good idea to spend time going over this concept with\nyour team and reinforcing it regularly.

      "1.6         \nSpirit of Volunteering 1.6         \nSpirit of Volunteering 2022 Season Spirit of Volunteering: A Message from\nthe Chief Volunteers to the FIRST Community  We know 2020 didn’t go as planned and 2021 was a year\nunlike any other for the FIRST Community. The 2022 season is shaping up to be\nanother non-traditional year. With that in mind, we think it’s more important\nthan ever to recognize the two phrases which drive and motivate the individuals\nthat volunteer their time for FIRST: “Giving Back” and “Pay It Forward”. This\nyear will be a year where you can help create the best-ever experience for our\nmentors, coaches, students, and fellow volunteers. Volunteering has enormous, lifelong impacts for\neveryone involved. Every student, teacher, event volunteer, mentor, coach, and family\nmember learns and grows throughout the season as they interact with each other\n– via both in-person as well as virtual interactions. There are tremendous\ngrowth opportunities for all!  To our team members and mentors: Whether you are\nattending events remotely or hopefully in-person, remember that the volunteers\nyou interact with are giving up their most precious asset - their time - to\nensure that all teams have a fulfilling, fun, and memorable competition.\nVolunteers are the lifeblood of FIRST and without them, FIRST would not be\nwhere it is today. We encourage you to remember that Gracious Professionalism\nis part of the ethos of FIRST. It's a way of doing things that encourages\nhigh-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and\nthe community. To our loyal volunteers – and everyone else that is\nconsidering volunteering - we want to encourage you to join us in whatever\ncapacity that you can for the 2022 season. There’s a lot to gain from\nvolunteering and part of what makes it so much fun is: • \nSeeing capable students learning and growing • \nMaking new friends with other awesome volunteers • \nBeing a part of the magic that makes an event happen • \nSharing FIRST with folks who didn’t know about it • \nTaking event experiences back to your team • \nLearning how to communicate with people outside of your normal circle Just as with so many other circumstances and\nsituations in our lives these last couple of years, volunteering for FIRST\nRobotics Competition in 2022 will probably look a little different. We know a\nday will come when we will put this virus behind us. And we know that together,\nwe will adapt, stay connected, engage our teams, and continue to move\n#FIRSTFORWARD.  To our FIRST alumni – We need you! You know the impact\nof FIRST in your life and the opportunity you’ve been given. We’re asking you\nto pay it forward and help the next generation have the same opportunity.

      '1.7          This Document & Its\nConventions 1.7          This Document & Its\nConventions The 2022 Game Manual is a resource for all FIRST\nRobotics Competition teams for information specific to the 2022 season and the\nRAPID REACT game. Its audience will find the following detail:  •                 \na general overview of the RAPID REACT game, •                 \ndetail about the RAPID REACT playing Field, •                 \na description of how to play the RAPID REACT game, •                 \ngame rules (related to safety, conduct, game play, inspection, etc.),\nand •                 \na description of how teams advance at 2022 tournaments and throughout\nthe season All participants should also study the Event\nRules Manual as it details event rules and expectations that perpetuate\nfrom season to season. That content complements, and carries the same weight\nas, this document.  The intent of this manual is that the text means exactly,\nand only, what it says. Please avoid interpreting the text based on assumptions\nabout intent, implementation of past rules, or how a situation might be in\n“real life.” There are no hidden requirements or restrictions. If you’ve read\neverything, you know everything. Specific methods are used throughout this manual to\nhighlight warnings, cautions, key words, and phrases. These conventions are\nused to alert the reader to important information and are intended help teams\nin constructing a Robot that complies with the\nrules in a safe manner. Links to other section headings in this manual and external\narticles appear in blue underlined text. All rule\nreferences are also hyperlinks to the rule even though they do not appear as\nblue underlined text. Key words that have a particular meaning within the context\nof the FIRST Robotics Competition and\nRAPID REACT are defined in the Section 12 Glossary\nsection and indicated in all caps throughout\nthis document.  The rule numbering method indicates the section, subsection,\nand position of the rule within that subsection. The letter indicates the\nsection in which the rule is published.  •                 \nG for Section 7 Game Rules: Robots •                 \nH for Section 8 Game Rules: Humans •                 \nR for Section 9 Robot Construction Rules •                 \nI for Section 10 Inspection and Eligibility\nRules •                 \nT for Section 11 Tournaments The following digit(s) represents the subsection in which\nthe rule can be found. The final digits indicate the rule’s position within\nthat subsection. Figure 1‑2 Rule numbering method  Imperial dimensions are followed by comparable metric\ndimensions in parentheses to provide metric users with the approximate size,\nweight, etc. Metric conversions for non-rules (e.g. dimensions) round to the\nnearest whole unit, e.g. "17 in. (~43 cm)” and “6 ft. 4 in. (~193 cm).”\nMetric conversions in rules round such that the metric dimension is compliant\nwith the rule (i.e. maximums round down, minimums round up). The metric\nconversions are offered for convenient reference only and do not overrule or\ntake the place of the imperial dimensions presented in this manual and the\nofficial drawings (i.e., dimensions and rules will always defer to measurements\nusing imperial units). Rules include colloquial language, also called headlines, in\nan effort to convey an abbreviated intent of the rule or rule set. There are\ntwo versions of headline formatting. Evergreen rules, or rules which are\nexpected to go relatively unchanged from season to season, are indicated with a\nleading asterisk and their rule number and headline are presented in bold green text. “Relatively unchanged” means\nthat the overall intent and presence of the rule from season to season is\nconstant, but game specific terms may be updated as needed (e.g.  changing\nPower Cells to Cargo in a rule about what coaches may not contact during a match). These rules also start their respective\nsection, so their rule number is not expected to change from season to season.\nAll other rule headlines use bold blue text. Any\ndisagreement between the specific language used in the rules and the colloquial\nlanguage is an error, and the specific rule language is the ultimate authority.\nIf you discover a disparity, please let us know at firstroboticscompetition@firstinspires.org\nand we will correct it.  Team resources that aren’t generally season specific (e.g.,\nwhat to expect at an event, communication resources, team organization\nrecommendations, Robot transportation\nprocedures, and award descriptions) can be found on the FIRST Robotics\nCompetition website.',

Teams\ncan search for previously asked questions and responses or pose new questions.\nQuestions can include examples for clarity or reference multiple rules to\nunderstand the relationships and differences between them. The Q&A opens on January 12, 2022, 12:00 PM Eastern.\nDetails on the Q&A can be found on the RAPID\nREACT - Season Materials web page. The Q&A may result in revisions to\nthe text in the official manuals (which are communicated using the process\ndescribed in Section 1.9 Team Updates). The responses in the Q&A do not supersede the text in\nthe manual, although every effort will be made to eliminate inconsistencies\nbetween the two. While responses provided in the Q&A may be used to aid\ndiscussion at each event, per Section\n10 Inspection & Eligibility Rules and Section\n11.2 Referee Interaction, Referees and inspectors\nare the ultimate authority on rules. If you have concerns about enforcement\ntrends by volunteer authorities, please notify FIRST at firstroboticscompetition@firstinspires.org.\n The Q&A is not a resource for firm predictions on how a\nsituation will play out an event. Questions about the following will not be\naddressed: •                 \nrulings on vague situations,  •                 \nchallenging decisions made at past events, or  •                 \ndesign reviews of a Robot system for\nlegality.  Weak questions are overly broad, vague, and/or include no\nrule references. Some examples of questions that will not be answered in the\nQ&A are: •                 \nIs this part/design legal? •                 \nHow should the Referee have ruled when\nthis specific game play happened? •                 \nDuplicate questions •                 \nNonsense questions Good questions ask generically about features of parts or\ndesigns, gameplay scenarios, or rules, and often reference one or more relevant\nrules within the question. Some examples of questions that will likely be\nanswered in the Q&A are: •                 \nA device we are considering using on the Robot\ncomes with purple AWG 40 wire, does this comply\nwith R?? and R?? •                 \nWe’re not sure how to interpret how Rule G?? applies if blue Robot A does X and red Robot\nB does Y, can you please clarify? •                 \nIf a Robot does this specific action, is\nit doing what this defined term is describing? Questions from “FRC 9999” represent content asked by key\nvolunteers (e.g., Referees, Inspectors, etc.), answered by FIRST, and are\nconsidered relevant to teams.    2      \nFIRST\nSeason Overview  In the 2022 season, FIRST®\nFORWARDSM presented by Qualcomm, FIRST teams will explore\nthe future of transportation. From the shipment of packages in rural and urban\nareas, to disaster relief delivery and high-tech air transit, teams will re-imagine\nfaster, more reliable, inclusive, and sustainable transportation innovations\nthat better connect and grow communities and economies around the world. This year, FIRST teams will address today’s global\nchallenges related to United Nations\nSustainable Development Goal #9,\nfocused on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and\nsustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. By encouraging FIRST\nparticipants to think about future transportation sustainability, we’re also\nempowering them to be the next generation of leaders and innovators, tackling\nthe world’s toughest challenges.    3      \nGame Sponsor Recognition     4      \nGame Overview Figure 4‑1 RAPID REACT\nfield and key elements  In RAPID REACTSM presented by The Boeing Company,\ntwo competing alliances are invited to process cargo for transportation. Each\nalliance is assigned a cargo color (red or blue, based on alliance affiliation)\nto process by retrieving their assigned cargo and scoring it into the hub.\nHuman players assist the cargo retrieval and scoring efforts from within their\nterminals. In the final moments of each match, alliance robots race to engage\nwith their hangar to prepare for transport! Each match begins with a 15-second autonomous period, during\nwhich time alliance robots operate only on pre-programmed instructions to score\npoints by: ·       \ntaxiing from their tarmac and  ·       \nretrieving and scoring their assigned cargo into the hub. In the final 2 minutes and 15 seconds of the match, drivers\ntake control of the robots and score points by: ·       \ncontinuing to retrieve and score their assigned cargo into the hub and ·       \nengaging with their hangar. The alliance with the highest score at the end of the match\nwins!      5       ARENA The Arena includes\nall elements of the game infrastructure that are required to play RAPID REACTSM:\nthe Field, Cargo,\nand all equipment needed for Field and robot management. The Arena is modular and\nassembled, used, disassembled, and shipped many times during the competition\nseason. It will undergo wear and tear. The Arena\nis designed to withstand rigorous play and frequent shipping. Every effort is\nmade to ensure that Arenas are consistent from\nevent to event. However, Arenas are assembled\nin different venues by different event staff and some small variations occur.\nFor details regarding assembly tolerances, please refer to the 2022\nArena Layout and Marking Diagram.\nSuccessful teams will design Robots that are\ninsensitive to these variations. Illustrations included in this section are for a general\nvisual understanding of the RAPID REACT Arena,\nand dimensions included in the manual are nominal. Please refer to the official\ndrawings for exact dimensions, tolerances, and construction details. The\nofficial drawings, CAD models, and drawings for low-cost versions of important\nelements of the RAPID REACT Field are posted on\nthe RAPID\nREACT - Season Materials web page on the FIRST website.",

It consists of 2\nfunnel-shaped goals (an Upper Hub and a lower Hub), upper and\nLower Exits, and 4 fenders. The Hub is 8 ft. 11 in. (~272 cm) wide by 8 ft. 11 in. (~272 cm) deep by 8 ft. 8 in. (~264 cm)\ntall. An agitator extends up the center of each Hub and rotates throughout the Match. The motors driving the agitator assemblies are\nsupplied with (nominal) 12V each, and their direction may vary from MATCH to MATCH.\nGenerally, the agitator causes a single Cargo\ndropped into the Upper Hub to reenter play in\napproximately 7 seconds and a cargo dropped in\nthe lower Hub to reenter play in approximately\n5 seconds.  An Upper Exit is 1 of\nthe 4 extensions on which Cargo leaves the Upper Hub, and a Lower\nExit is one of the 4 tunnels from which Cargo leaves the lower Hub.  4 legs, each centered under an UPPER EXIT, support the Upper Hub. The maximum Robot\nheight defined in G106 is marked with black tape on each leg (i.e. the bottom\nedge of the tape is 4 ft. 4 in. (~132 cm) above FIELD carpet). A fender is\nlocated in between each of the Lower Exits.  \n\n5.3.1  \nUPPER HUB and LOWER HUB\n\n Figure 5‑11 Hub with\nnominal dimensions  The opening of the lower Hub\nis 3 ft. 5 in.

Each Driver\nStation is made from a 3 ft. ¾ in. (~93 cm) tall diamond plate base\ntopped with a 3 ft. 6 in. (~107 cm) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top\nrail. An aluminum shelf is attached to each Driver\nStation to support an Operator Console.\nThe shelf is 5 ft. 9 in. (~175 cm) wide and 1 ft. ¼ in. (~31 cm) deep. There is\na 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip of hook-and-loop\ntape (“loop” side) along the center of the support shelf that may be used to\nsecure the Operator Console to the shelf.  Each Driver Station contains\nthe following elements for drive teams: \n 1 Ethernet cable:\n     attaches to the Ethernet port of the Operator\n     Console and provides connectivity to the Field\n     Management System (FMS)\n 1 120VAC NEMA 5-15R\n     power outlet (i.e. standard US outlet): located on each Driver Station shelf and protected by its own\n     2-Amp circuit breaker. It can be used to power the Operator Console. drive\n     teams are responsible for monitoring their power consumption as a\n     tripped breaker in the outlet does not constitute an Arena Fault. For some events in regions that\n     don’t use NEMA 5-15 shaped outlets, event organizers may install\n     appropriate plug adapters to be used throughout the event. \n 1 Emergency Stop\n     (E-Stop) button: located on the left side of the Driver\n     Station shelf and is used to deactivate a Robot\n     in an emergency \n 1 team sign: displays\n     the team number and located at the top of each Driver\n     Station\n 1 team LED stack:\n     indicates Alliance color, Robot status, E-Stop status, and is centered at\n     the top of each Driver Station. \n The stack includes 2 identical alliance-colored robot\nstatus LEDs above a third amber E-stop LED. LED states are as follows:  \n \n  robot status LEDs\n  \n   Solid: indicates that\n       the Robot is connected and enabled. This\n       only happens during a Match.\n   Blinking: indicates\n       that either the FMS is preset for the Match and the Robot\n       is not connected yet, or it’s during a Match\n       and the corresponding Robot is Bypassed, has lost connectivity, or the E-stop\n       was pressed.\n   Off: indicates that\n       the Robot is linked and Disabled prior to the start of the Match. This light is also off, regardless of Robot connection status, after the Match has concluded. \n  \n  E-stop LED\n  \n   Solid: the robot is disabled\n       due to a press of the team E-stop button, the field\n       E-stop button, or by the scorekeeper via the FMS. \n   Off: the robot is not disabled\n       by the field. \n  \n \n ·       \n1 string of LED nodes described in Section\n5.6.1.1 Driver Station LED Strings. \n 1 timer (in Driver Station 2 only): displays the official\n     time remaining in the Match and Timeouts.

Figure\n5‑25 FIELD is safe for humans  During a match, nodes 1\nthrough 4 and 15-17 are yellow if the match is\nin auto (as shown in Figure 5‑26) and\nwhite if in teleop (as shown in Figure 5‑27\nand Figure 5‑28). Additionally, the center 10\nnodes of each string, 5 through 14, indicate the Alliance’s\nCargo Bonus progress in the Alliance’s color. The first scored Cargo causes node 5 to turn on. The second Cargo causes node 5 to dim. The third Cargo causes the\nnode 6 to turn on; the fourth Cargo causes node\n6 to dim, and so on (see Figure 5‑26, Figure 5‑27, and Figure 5‑28). If an alliance achieves a quintet (as described in Table 6‑1), node 14\nturns on (see Figure 5‑27) indicating the lowered threshold to achieve\nthe cargo bonus.

      "11.2       Referee Interaction 11.2       Referee Interaction The Head Referee has the\nultimate authority in the Arena during the\nevent, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game Designers, FIRST\npersonnel, FTA, and technical staff. The Head Referee rulings are final. No event personnel,\nincluding the Head Referee, will review video,\nphotos, artistic renderings, etc. of any Match,\nfrom any source, under any circumstances. If a drive team needs\nclarification on a ruling or score, per H202, 1 student\nfrom that drive team should address the Head Referee after the Arena\nReset Signal (e.g. Field lights turn green). A drive team member signals their desire to speak with\nthe Head Referee by standing in the\ncorresponding red or blue Question Box, which are located on the floor near\neach end of the scoring table. Depending on timing, the Head Referee may postpone any requested discussion until\nthe end of the subsequent Match as necessary. While FMS tracks quantities\nof Fouls, FIRST instructs Referees to not self-track details about Fouls and Tech Fouls;\nas a result, we don’t expect Referees to recall\ndetails about what Fouls and Tech Fouls were made, when they occurred, and\nagainst whom. \n\n11.2.1            \nYellow and Red\nCards\n\n In addition to rule violations explicitly listed throughout\nthe 2022 Game Manual, Yellow Cards and Red Cards are used in FIRST Robotics Competition to address team and Robot behavior that does not align with the mission,\nvalues, and culture of FIRST. As noted in Section 6.5 Rule\nViolations and H201, the Head Referee may\nassign a Yellow Card as a warning, or a Red Card for DISQUALIFICATION in Match for egregious behavior inappropriate at a FIRST\nRobotics Competition event. A yellow or Red Card is indicated by the Head Referee standing in front of the team’s Driver Station and holding a yellow and/or Red Card\nin the air. Per Section 6.5 Rule\nViolations, Yellow Cards are additive,\nmeaning that a second Yellow Card is\nautomatically converted to a Red Card. A team\nis issued a Red Card for any subsequent\nincident in which they receive an additional Yellow\nCard, including earning a second Yellow Card\nduring a single Match. A second Yellow Card is indicated by the Head Referee standing in front of the team’s Driver Station and holding a Yellow Card and Red Card\nin the air simultaneously after the completion of the Match.\nA team that has received either a Yellow Card\nor a Red Card carries a Yellow Card into subsequent Matches,\nexcept as noted below.  Once a team receives a yellow\nor Red Card, its team number is presented with\na yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning of all subsequent Matches, including any replays, as a reminder to the\nteam, the Referees, and the audience that they\ncarry a Yellow Card. Figure 11‑2 Example\naudience screen graphic showing Yellow Card\nindicators  All Yellow Cards are cleared\nin FMS at the conclusion of Practice, Qualification,\nand division Playoff Matches. Verbal warnings\nare cleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES\nthrough subsequent tournament phases.

      "11.3      \nMatch\nReplays 11.3      \nMatch\nReplays Over the course of the tournament, it may be necessary for a\nMatch to be replayed. Typical causes for\nreplays are Matches that end in a tie during\nthe Playoffs, Matches that are stopped because Field Staff anticipated Field\ndamage or personal injury, or if there is an Arena\nFault. An Arena Fault is an error in Arena operation\nthat includes, but is not limited to:  A.     broken Field elements due to  a.     \nnormal, expected game play or  b.     \nRobot abuse of Field\nelements that affects the outcome of the Match\nfor their opponents, B.     power\nfailure to a portion of the Field (tripping the\ncircuit breaker in the Driver Station is not\nconsidered a power failure), C.     improper\nactivation by the FMS, and D.     errors by Field Staff (except those listed in Section 6.7 Other Logistics).  If, in the judgment of the Head Referee,\nan Arena Fault occurs that affects the outcome\nof the Match and any team on the affected Alliance desires a replay, the Match will be replayed. FIRST Headquarters\nreserves the right to, with consultation of the Head REFEREE and the FTA,\nreplay a MATCH in which an ARENA FAULT impacts the outcome of an event. All reasonable effort is made to create the same conditions\nwhen replaying a Match caused by an ARENA FAULT\nor FIELD damage. This means, for example, that a team that was Bypassed prior to the start of the Match which is to be replayed is Bypassed for the replay Match.\nRobot and drive team\nstarting locations do not need to be replicated when replaying a Match.",

Each Qualification schedule consists of a series of\nrounds in which each team plays 1 Match per\nround.  \n\n11.6.2            \nMatch Assignment\n\n FMS assigns each team 2 Alliance partners for each Qualification Match using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not\nswitch Qualification Match assignments. The\nalgorithm employs the following criteria, listed in order of priority: 1.     maximize time between each Match played for all teams 2.     minimize the number of times\na team plays opposite any team 3.     minimize the number of times\na team is allied with any team 4.     minimize the use of Surrogates (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to play an extra Qualification Match) 5.     provide even distribution of\nMatches played on blue and red Alliance 6.     provide even distribution of\nMatches played in each Driver Station number At events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the\ncriteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of\ntimes a team swaps between the blue and red alliance\nrather than an even distribution. All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification Matches, equal to the number of rounds, unless the\nnumber of teams multiplied by number of Matches\nis not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly\nselects some teams to play an extra Match. For\nthe purpose of seeding calculations, those teams are designated as Surrogates for the extra Match.\nIf a team plays a Match as a Surrogate, it is indicated on the Match schedule, it is always their third\nQualification Match, and the outcome of the Match has no effect on the team’s ranking. yellow and Red Cards\nassigned to Surrogates, however, do carry\nforward to subsequent Matches. \n\n11.6.3            \nQualification Ranking\n\n Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their Alliance’s performance in Qualification Matches. Ranking Points are awarded to each eligible\nteam at the completion of each Qualification Match\nper Table 6‑1. Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows: A.     A Surrogate receives 0 Ranking Points. B.     A Disqualified team, as determined by the Head Referee, receives 0 Ranking Points in a Qualification\nMatch or causes their Alliance\nto receive 0 Match points in a Playoff Match. C.     A\n“no-show” team is either Disqualified from or\nissued a Red Card for that Match (see H305). A team is declared a no-show if no\nmember of the drive team is in the Alliance Area at the start of the Match. The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team\nthroughout their Qualification Matches divided\nby the number of Matches they’ve been scheduled\nto play (minus any Surrogate Match), then truncated to 2 decimal places, is their\nRanking Score (RS). All teams participating in Qualification Matches are ranked by Ranking Score. If the number of\nteams in attendance is ‘n’, they are ranked ‘1’ through ‘n’, with ‘1’ being the\nteam with the highest Ranking Score and ‘n’ being the team with the lowest\nRanking Score. Teams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria\ndefined in Table 11‑2.

      "11.7      \nPlayoff Matches 11.7      \nPlayoff Matches In Playoff Matches, teams do\nnot earn Ranking Points; they earn a Win, Loss or Tie. Within each series of\nthe Playoff Match Bracket, the first Alliance to win 2 Matches\nadvances.  In the case where the Quarterfinal or Semifinal Match scores for both Alliances\nare equal, the win is awarded to the Alliance\nper criteria listed in Table 11‑3. A Disqualified\nteam, as determined by the Head Referee, causes\ntheir Alliance to receive 0 Match points in a Playoff Match. In Finals Matches, the\nChampion Alliance is the first Alliance to win 2 Matches.\nIn the case where an Alliance hasn’t won 2 Matches after 3 Matches\nhave been played (because of tied matches),\nthe Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals Matches,\ncalled Overtime Matches, until an Alliance has won 2 Finals Matches.\nIn the case where the Overtime Match scores for\nboth Alliances are equal, the win for that\nOvertime Match is awarded based on the criteria\nlisted in Table 11‑3.

The seeded Alliances are designated, in order, Alliance 1, Alliance\n2, etc., down to Alliance 8. Using the Alliance selection process described in this section,\neach Alliance Lead chooses 2 other teams to\njoin their Alliance. If a team declines the Alliance\nLead position or doesn’t send a student\nrepresentative for Alliance selection, they are\nineligible to participate in the Playoff Tournament. If the declining/absent\nteam would have been an Alliance Lead, all\nlower ranked Alliance Leads are promoted 1\nspot. The next highest-ranked team moves up to become the Alliance 8 Lead. Each team chooses a student\nteam representative who proceeds to the Arena\nat the designated time (typically before the lunch break on the final day of\nthe event) to represent their team. The designated student representative from each Alliance in a Playoff Match\nis called the Alliance Captain. The Alliance selection\nprocess consists of 2 rounds during which each Alliance\nCaptain invites a team seeded below them in the standings to join their Alliance. The invited team must not already have\ndeclined an invitation. Round 1: In descending order (Alliance 1 to Alliance\n8), each Alliance Captain invites a single\nteam. The invited team’s representative steps forward and either accepts or\ndeclines the invitation. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that Alliance. If an invitation from a top 8 Alliance to another Alliance\nLead is accepted, all lower Alliance Leads are\npromoted 1 spot. The next highest-seeded, unselected team moves up to become\nthe Alliance 8 Lead. If the team declines, that team is not eligible to be picked\nagain or to be a Backup Team (see Playoff Match Bracket), and the Alliance\nCaptain extends another invitation to a different team. If an invitation\nfrom a top 8 Alliance to another Alliance Lead is declined, the declining team may\nstill invite teams to join their Alliance;\nhowever, it cannot accept invitations from other Alliances. The process continues until Alliance\n8 makes a successful invitation. Round 2: The same method is used\nfor each Alliance Captain’s second choice except\nthe selection order is reversed, with Alliance\n8 picking first and Alliance 1 picking last.\nThis process results in 8 Alliances of 3 teams\neach. Of the remaining eligible teams, the highest seeded teams\nmust either accept or decline to be included in a pool of available teams until\nthere are up to 8 teams that accept to be added into the pool. Field Staff will coordinate the assembly of this\nBACKUP pool immediately after the top ranked Alliance\nhas made their final pick. If a team is not available to accept inclusion in\nthe BACKUP pool, it will be assumed they have declined the invitation. \n\n11.7.2            \nPlayoff Match Bracket\n\n The Playoff Matches take\nplace following the completion of the Qualification Matches\nand the Alliance selection process. Playoff Matches are played in a bracket format as shown in\nFigure 11‑3. Alliance Leads are assigned\nto Driver Station 2, the first picks are\nassigned to their left in Driver Station 1, and\nsecond picks are assigned to the Alliance\nLead’s right in Driver Station 3. If a Backup Team is in play, they will be assigned to the Driver Station that was assigned to the drive team they’re replacing. Teams cannot change\nassignments. For Quarterfinal Matches,\nthe higher seeded Alliance is assigned to the\nred Alliance. Beyond the Quarterfinal Matches, the Alliance\non the top of each Match in Figure 11‑3\nis assigned to the red Alliance, regardless of\nwhether they are the higher seeded Alliance in\nthat particular Match. Figure\n11‑3 Playoff Match bracket  In order to allow time\nbetween Matches for all Alliances, the order of play is as follows: Table 11‑4 Playoff order \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Quarterfinal\n   Round 1\n   \n   \n   Quarterfinal\n   Round 2\n   \n   \n   Quarterfinal\n   Round 3\n   \n   \n   Semifinals\n   \n   \n   Finals\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  1\n  (1 vs.\n  8)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  5\n  (1 vs.\n  8)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  Tiebreaker\n  11\n  \n  \n  Semifinal\n  1\n  \n  \n  Final 1\n  \n \n \n  \n  Quarterfinal 2\n  (4 vs. 5)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal 6\n  (4 vs. 5)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  Tiebreaker 21\n  \n  \n  Semifinal 2\n  \n  \n  Field\n  Timeout\n  \n \n \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  3\n  (2 vs.\n  7)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  7\n  (2 vs.\n  7)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  Tiebreaker\n  31\n  \n  \n  Semifinal\n  3\n  \n  \n  Final 2\n  \n \n \n  \n  Quarterfinal 4\n  (3 vs. 6)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal 8\n  (3 vs. 6)\n  \n  \n  Quarterfinal\n  Tiebreaker 41\n  \n  \n  Semifinal 4\n  \n  \n  Field\n  Timeout\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Field Timeout1\n  \n  \n  Field Timeout1\n  \n  \n  Semifinal\n  Tiebreaker\n  11\n  \n  \n  Final\n  Tiebreakers\n  \n  (Overtime) 1\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Any Replays\n  due to ties1\n  \n  \n  Semifinal \n  Tiebreaker 21\n  \n  \n  Any Replays\n  due to ties1\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Field Timeout1\n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Any Replays\n  due to ties1\n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n\n\n 1 - if required \n\n11.7.3            \nPit Crews\n\n During the Playoff Matches, extra\nteam members may be needed to maintain the Robot\nbetween Matches because of the distance between\nthe Field and the pit area. Each team is\npermitted to have 3 additional pit crew members who can also help with needed Robot repairs/maintenance. \n\n11.7.4            \nTimeouts\n\n A Timeout is a period of up to 8 minutes between Matches\nwhich is used to pause Playoff Match\nprogression.  During a Timeout, the Arena timer displays the time remaining in the Timeout. Both Alliances\nenjoy the complete 8-minute window. If an Alliance\ncompletes their repairs before the Arena timer\nexpires, the Alliance Captain is encouraged to\ninform the Head Referee that they are ready to\nplay. If both Alliances are ready to play\nbefore the Timeout expires, the next Match will start. There are no Timeouts for\nPractice or Qualification Matches. If circumstances require an Alliance\nto play in back-to-back Matches during the\nPlayoff Matches, the Head Referee will issue a Field\nTimeout to allow teams to prepare for the next Match. Field Timeouts are the same time duration as Timeouts and begin once the HANGARS are clear of\nROBOTS and the MATCH results have been posted.

The\nequation utilizes the following variables: ·       \nR – the qualification rank of the team at the event at the conclusion of\nQualification Matches (as reported by FMS) ·       \nN – the number of FIRST Robotics\nCompetition teams participating in the Qualification rounds at the event ·       \nAlpha (α) – a static value (1.07) used to standardize the\ndistribution of points at events This formula generates an approximately normal distribution\nof Qualification Round Performance points at an event, based on rank, with most\nteams getting a moderate number of points, and fewer teams getting the highest\nor lowest numbers of points available. Table 11‑7 displays sample Qualification Round\nPerformance points for variously ranked teams at a 40-team event. The system\nwill automatically generate the appropriate points for each team based on their\nrank and the number of teams at the event.

Alliance Captains are\nrecognized based on their qualification round seeding rank. This rank is a\nresult of the rules of the game, which typically incorporate several team\nperformance attributes, and are designed to eliminate ties in rank. Non-Alliance Captains are rewarded based on peer\nrecognition. To be invited to join an Alliance,\na team’s peers have decided that the team has attributes that are desirable.\nGiving points for Alliance selection also\nsupports come-from-behind teams. A team taking several Matches to optimize their performance may be\nrecognized as a late bloomer by a top seeded team, even if that performance\nisn’t reflected in the rankings because of poor performance in early Matches. These points also have the potential to\nrecognize teams employing a minority strategy with their Robot. Teams with unique or divergent Robot capabilities that complement the strengths of\nother Alliance members may be selected to fill\na strategic niche. Note also that Alliance Captains\nare given the same number of points as the team drafted in the same sequence.\nFor example, the third Alliance Captain gets\nthe same number of points as the third draft. Numerical analysis supports the\nidea that Alliance Captains are about as strong\nin Robot performance as equivalently drafted\nteams. As an additional minor benefit, awarding the same points for Alliance Captains and equivalent drafts lubricates\nthe acceptance of draft offers between Alliance\nCaptains, which gives teams out of the top 8 (or 4, if a Single-Day\nEvent) the chance to experience being Alliance\nCaptains themselves. 11.8.1.3     \nPlayoff Round\nPerformance This attribute measures team performance as part of an Alliance. All teams on the Alliance\nwinning a particular playoff series, who participate in Matches with their Robots,\nreceive 5 points per Match won. In most cases,\nteams receive 10 points at each of the Quarterfinal, Semifinal, and Final\nlevels, unless a BACKUP Robot is called in to\nplay. For Single-Day Events, there is no Quarterfinal level so teams can\nreceive up to 20 points for winning at the Semifinal and Final levels. 11.8.1.4      Awards This attribute measures team performance with respect to\nteam awards judged at the event. The points earned for team awards in this system are not\nintended to capture the full value of the award to the team winning the award,\nor to represent the full value of the award to FIRST. In many ways, the\nteam’s experience in being selected for awards, especially the Chairman’s\nAward, the Engineering Inspiration Award, and the Rookie All Star Award (which\nis optional for District Championship events), is beyond measure, and could not\nbe fully captured in its entirety by any points-based system. Points are being\nassigned to awards in this system only to help teams recognize that FIRST\ncontinues to be “More than RobotsSM,” with the emphasis on our\ncultural awards, and to assist in elevating award-winning teams above non-award-winning\nteams in the ranking system. Teams only get points for team awards judged at the event.\nIf an award is not judged (e.g. Rookie Highest Seed), is not for a team (e.g.\nthe Dean’s List Award) or is not judged at the event (e.g. Safety Animation Award,\nsponsored by UL), no points are earned.  11.8.1.5     \nTeam Age This attribute recognizes the\ndifficulty in being a rookie or relatively new team. Points are awarded to 2020, 2021, and 2022 rookie teams in\nrecognition of the unique challenges teams face in those early years, and to\nincrease the chance that they will make it to the District Championship to\ncompete with their Robots. Like our dedicated\nRookie awards, these additional points are intended to recognize and motivate\nnewer participants in FIRST Robotics Competition.\nThese points are awarded once at the beginning of the season. Rookie year is\ncalculated based on the year in which FIRST recognizes the team as a\nrookie.  11.8.1.6      Regional Participation District teams do not earn\npoints for their actions at any Regionals they may attend, nor are eligible for\nFIRST Championship qualifying judged awards at those events. However, if\na District team does earn a slot at the FIRST Championship while\nattending a Regional event, that slot does count as part of the total\nChampionship allocation the District is receiving for the season. \n\n11.8.2            \nDistrict Championship Eligibility\n\n A team competing in a District qualifies for their District\nChampionship by meeting 1 of the following criteria: A.     District\nChairman’s Award Winner, B.     District\nRanking (based on total points earned at their first 2 home District events as\ndetailed in District Events),   C.     District\nEngineering Inspiration winner (qualifies to compete for the award only), and D.     District\nRookie All Star winner (qualifies to compete for the award only). The capacity of each District Championship is shown in Table\n11‑8. Each District determines the number of teams that qualify for their\nDistrict Championship. These limits are based on factors including but not\nlimited to the total number of teams in the District, available venue capacity,\netc. Table 11‑8\n2022 District Championship Capacities \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   District\n   Championship\n   \n   \n   Capacity\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  FIRST Chesapeake District Championship\n  \n  \n  60\n  \n \n \n  \n  FIRST Israel District\n  Championship\n  \n  \n  40\n  \n \n \n  \n  FIRST Mid-Atlantic District Championship\n  \n  \n  60\n  \n \n \n  \n  FIRST North Carolina\n  State Championship\n  \n  \n  32\n  \n \n \n  \n  FIRST Ontario Provincial Championship\n  \n  \n  80\n  \n \n \n  \n  FIRST in Texas District\n  Championship\n  \n  \n  80\n  \n \n \n  \n  Indiana\n  State Championship\n  \n  \n  32\n  \n \n \n  \n  Michigan State Championship\n  \n  \n  160\n  \n \n \n  \n  New\n  England District Championship\n  \n  \n  80\n  \n \n \n  \n  Pacific Northwest District\n  Championship\n  \n  \n  50\n  \n \n \n  \n  Peachtree\n  District State Championship\n  \n  \n  32\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n11.8.3            \nDistrict Championships with Multiple Divisions\n\n Some District Championships\nhave a sufficient number of teams to justify using more than 1 division. Teams\nare assigned divisions by FIRST using a process developed by FIRST\nin Michigan.  The process employs a “brute force iterative randomizer” and\nis executed as follows:  1.     The district team list is\nsorted in order of cumulative district points earned as described in District\nEvents. 2.     The list is divided into\nquartiles based on rank (e.g. the first quartile has the top 25% ranked teams). 3.     Division assignments are\nrandomly generated using equal contribution from each quartile. 4.     3 criteria are calculated\nfor each division: a.     \naverage strength: the arithmetic mean of the district point values of\nteams in a division b.     \ndistribution of strength: the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the\ndistrict point values of teams in a division. SNR is calculated as follows:    =\narithmetic mean of the district points in a division σ = standard deviation of\nthe district points in a division c.     \ndistribution of strength for “top” teams: The SNR of the district point\nvalues of teams in the first quartile of a division 5.     The 3 criteria for each\ndivision are compared to the other division(s). If the difference between the\ndivision’s value and any other division’s value exceeds the limits in Table 11‑9,\nthe criteria is not met.

      "11.9      \nFIRST\nChampionship: Additions and Exceptions 11.9      \nFIRST\nChampionship: Additions and Exceptions At the 2022 FIRST Championship, teams are split into\n6 divisions. The process used to assign teams to their division is as follows:  1.     Rookies are assigned\nrandomly, team by team, sequentially to divisions (i.e. a team in Division 1, a\nteam in Division 2, a team in Division 3, a team in Division 4, a team in\nDivision 5, a team in Division 6, then back to Division 1 again, until Rookies\nare all assigned to a division).  2.     Step 1 is repeated with\nveteran teams. Each division plays a standard tournament as described in\nQualification Matches and Playoff Matches to produce the division Champions. Those 6\ndivision Champions proceed to the Championship Playoffs, on the Einstein Fields, to determine the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition Championship Winners, per FIRST\nChampionship Playoffs. \n\n11.9.1            \nAdvancement to the FIRST Championship\n\n Details on how teams earn eligibility to attend the FIRST\nChampionship are posted on the FIRST\nChampionship eligibility webpage.  \n\n11.9.2            \n4 Robot Alliances\n\n There is no provision for Backup\nTeams at the FIRST Championship. Instead, before each division Playoff Tournament, Alliances are selected per the process as described\nin Section 11.7.1 Alliance Selection Process, however the\nprocess continues with a third round of selection as follows. Round 3: The same method is used\nfor each Alliance Captain’s third choice except\nthe selection order is reversed again, with Alliance\n1 picking first and Alliance 8 picking last.\nThis process results in 8 Alliances of 4 teams\neach. Alliances may start with any\n3 of the 4 Robots on their Alliance during division Playoff Matches and during the Championship Playoffs. The list of 3 teams participating in the Match\nand their selected Driver Stations is\ncalled the Lineup. A single representative from\nthe team not on the Lineup is allowed as a\nsixteenth Alliance member. This additional\nrepresentative may only serve in an advisory role and will be considered a Coach (e.g. can’t be a Human\nPlayer). The Lineup is kept confidential\nuntil the Field is set for the Match, at which point each Alliance’s\nLineup appears on the Team Signs. If an Alliance does not\nsubmit a Lineup for their first of the division\nPlayoffs or the Championship Playoffs within 2 minutes before the scheduled Match time, the Lineup\nis the Alliance Lead, first Alliance selection, and second Alliance selection. If any of these 3 Robots are unable to play, the Alliance must play the Match\nwith only 2 (or even 1) Robot(S). If an Alliance would like to\nchange their Lineup after their first division\nPlayoff or Championship Playoff Match, the Alliance Captain must report the Lineup to the Head Referee,\nor their designee, in writing prior to end of the preceding Match (e.g. the LineupS\nfor Quarterfinal 2 must be submitted before the end of Quarterfinal 1). If the\nHead Referee is busy and there is no designee\ndefined, the Alliance Captain waits in the\nquestion box to report the Lineup. Once the Lineup is declared,\nit cannot be changed unless there is a team or Field\nTimeout. If there is a Timeout, the Alliance\nCaptain may submit a different Lineup,\nbut must do so while there are still more than 2 minutes remaining in the Timeout. If a Match must be replayed\ndue to an Arena Fault, the Lineup for the replayed Match\nis the same as the original Match. The sole\nexception is if the Arena Fault rendered a Robot inoperable, in which case the Lineup can be changed. \n\n11.9.3            \nFIRST\nChampionship Pit Crews\n\n FIRST distributes buttons to the Alliance Captains during the Alliance Captain meeting, which takes place on the\ndivision Fields. These buttons provide the\nnecessary access to the Arena for pit crew\nmembers.",

The FMV of software licensed free-of-cost, including through the\nVirtual KOP, for use on the Robot is $0.\n\nThe FMV of FABRICATED parts is the\nvalue of the material and/or labor, except for labor provided by team members\n(including sponsor employees who are members of the team), members of other\nteams, and/or event provided machine shops. Material costs are accounted for as\nthe cost of any purchasable quantity that can be used to make the individual\npart (i.e. the purchasable raw material is larger than the FABRICATED part).\n\nExample 1: A team orders a custom\nbracket made by a company to the team's specification. The company’s material\ncost and normally charged labor rate apply.\n\nExample 2: A team receives a donated\nsensor. The company would normally sell this item for $450 USD, which is\ntherefore its FMV.\n\nExample 3: A team purchases titanium\ntube stock for $400 USD and has it machined by a local machine shop. The\nmachine shop is not considered a team sponsor but donates 2 hours of expended\nlabor anyway. The team must include the estimated normal cost of the labor as\nif it were paid to the machine shop and add it to the $400 USD.\n\nExample 4: A team purchases titanium\ntube stock for $400 USD and has it machined by a local machine shop that is a\nrecognized sponsor of the team. If the machinists are considered members of the\nteam, their labor costs do not apply. The total applicable cost for the part\nwould be $400 USD.\n\nIt is in the best interests of the\nteams and FIRST to form relationships with as many organizations as\npossible. Recognizing supporting companies as sponsors of, and members in, the\nteam is encouraged, even if the involvement of the sponsor is solely through\nthe donation of fabrication labor.\n\nExample 5: A team purchases titanium\ntube stock for $400 USD and has it machined by another team. The total\napplicable cost for the part would be $400 USD.\n\nExample 6: A team purchases a widget\nat a garage sale or online auction for $300, but it’s available for sale from a\nVendor for $700. The FMV is $700.\n\nIf a COTS\nitem is part of a modular system that can be assembled in several possible\nconfigurations, then each individual module must fit within the price\nconstraints defined in this rule. \n\nIf the modules are designed to\nassemble into a single configuration, and the assembly is functional in only\nthat configuration, then the total cost of the complete assembly including all\nmodules must fit within the price constraints defined in this rule.\n\nIn summary, if a Vendor sells a system or a kit, a team must use the\nentire system/kit FMV and not the value of its Component\npieces.\n\nExample 7: Vendor\nA sells a gearbox that can be used with a number of different gear sets, and\ncan mate with 2 different motors they sell. A team purchases the gearbox, a\ngear set, and a motor, then assembles them together. Each part is treated\nseparately for the purpose of determining FMV since the purchased pieces can\neach be used in various configurations.\n\nExample 8: Vendor\nB sells a robotic arm assembly that a team wants to use. However, it costs $630\nUSD, so they cannot use it. The Vendor sells\nthe “hand”, “wrist”, and “arm” as separate assemblies, for $210 USD each. A\nteam wishes to purchase the 3 items separately, then reassemble them. This\nwould not be legal, as they are really buying and using the entire assembly,\nwhich has a Fair Market Value of $630 USD.\n\nExample 9: Vendor\nC sells a set of wheels or wheel modules that are often used in groups of 4.\nThe wheels or modules can be used in other quantities or configurations. A team\npurchases 4 and uses them in the most common configuration. Each part is\ntreated separately for the purpose of determining FMV, since the purchased\npieces can be used in various configurations.\n\n",

Its team then decides they want to use Mechanism B, which was not inspected. The weight of\nthe Robot, A, and B is greater than the weight\nlimit in I103. This requires re-inspection per I104 and A is excluded to\nsatisfy I103. B breaks, and the team decides to switch back to A.

The Robot passes initial inspection\nwith A and plays a Match. The team switches to\nB, gets re-inspected, and plays again. The team switches back to A, gets\nre-inspected, and plays again.

At this point, the LRI suspects\nthe team may be violating this rule and has a discussion with the team to\nunderstand the changes being made.
