It’s a way of doing things that encourages high quality\nwork, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the\ncommunity. Gracious Professionalism is not clearly defined for a\nreason. It can and should mean different things to everyone. Some possible meanings of Gracious Professionalism\ninclude: -      \ngracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win, -      \ngracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their\nactions, -      \nprofessionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by\nsociety to use that knowledge responsibly, and  -      \ngracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner\npleasing to others and to themselves. In the context of FIRST, this means that all teams\nand participants should: -      \nlearn to be strong competitors, but also treat one another with\nrespect and kindness in the process and -      \navoid leaving anyone feeling as if they are excluded or\nunappreciated. Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and\ngenuinely blended. In the end, Gracious Professionalism is part of\npursuing a meaningful life. When professionals use knowledge in a gracious\nmanner and individuals act with integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and\nsociety benefits.

We recommend providing your team with\nreal-life examples of Gracious Professionalism in practice, such as when\na team loans valuable materials or expertise to another team that they will\nlater face as an opponent in competition. Routinely highlight opportunities to\ndisplay Gracious Professionalism at events and encourage team members to\nsuggest ways in which they can demonstrate this quality themselves and through\noutreach activities. 1.5     \nCoopertition® At FIRST, Coopertition® is\ndisplaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. Coopertition\nis founded on the concept and philosophy that teams can and should help and\ncooperate with one another even as they compete. Coopertition involves\nlearning from teammates and mentors. Coopertition means competing always\nbut assisting and enabling others when you can. Message from Woodie Flowers Award Recipients The Woodie Flowers Award is the most prestigious mentoring\naward in FIRST. The award recipients created an important message for all FIRST\nRobotics Competition teams to consider as we tackle each season. Performing at your best is important. Winning is important.\nThis is a competition. However, winning with Gracious Professionalism and being proud\nof what you have accomplished and how you have accomplished it is more\nimportant. FIRST could create rules and penalties to cover almost any scenario\nor situation, but we prefer an understandable game with simpler rules that\nallow us to think and be creative in our designs. We want to know that our partners and opponents are playing at\ntheir best in every MATCH. We want to know they are playing with integrity and\nnot using strategies based on questionable behaviors. As you create your ROBOTS and award presentations, prepare for\ncompetition and MATCH play, create and implement game strategies, and live your\ndaily lives, remember what Woodie said time and time again, and let’s ‘Make\nyour Grandmother proud.’  ","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144139\">1.4<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span><i>Gracious Professionalism</i><sup>®</sup>, a <i>FIRST</i> Credo</a></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Gracious Professionalism</i><sup>®</sup> is part of the\nethos of <i>FIRST</i>.

Each AMP has a vertical pocket\nthat is 3⅞ in. deep (~10 cm), 1 ft. 6 in. tall (~46 cm), and 2 ft. wide (~61\ncm). The bottom of the pocket is 2 ft. 2 in. (~66 cm) from the carpet. Each AMP\nis 4 ft. 1½ in. (~126 cm) from the closest ALLIANCE WALL. To keep the AMP clear\nfor scoring, the HUMAN PLAYER can shift scored NOTES away from the AMP exit. There are 2 sets of lights on top of the AMP; ALLIANCE-colored\nAMP lights and an amber Coopertition light. AMP lights indicate the\nnumber of NOTES accumulated for AMPLIFICATION or Coopertition. The Coopertition\nlight indicates progress toward Coopertition.  The AMP light behavior and meaning are as follows:  -      \nbottom light on: the ALLIANCE has 1 NOTE towards AMPLIFICATION (or\nCoopertition) -      \nboth lights on: the ALLIANCE has 2 NOTES toward AMPLIFICATION (1\nof which can be used for Coopertition)  -      \ntop light blinking at 2Hz: the SPEAKER is AMPLIFIED (see Section 6.5.3 AMPLIFICATION).  The Coopertition light behavior and meaning are as\nfollows:  -      \nblinking at 1 Hz: it’s AUTO or the initial 45 seconds of TELEOP\nand the ALLIANCE has not used a NOTE for Coopertition -      \nsolid on:  o  \nif initial 45 seconds of TELEOP, the HUMAN PLAYER has used a NOTE\nfor Coopertition o  \nif after the initial 45 seconds of TELEOP, both ALLIANCES have used\na NOTE for Coopertition -      \noff: the Coopertition window has expired, and Coopertition\nwas not accomplished  A wire panel (Uline\nH6277BL) is horizontally installed to the top of the guardrail and between\nthe AMP and the ALLIANCE WALL.   5.4     \nSOURCE Figure 5‑7 SOURCE  A SOURCE is an assembly through which HUMAN\nPLAYERS feed NOTES into the FIELD.

The lowest edge of the SPEAKER\nopening is 6 ft. 6 in. (~198 cm) from the carpet, and the highest edge of the\nopening is 6 ft. 10⅞ in. (~211 cm) above the carpet. The opening is 3 ft.\n5⅜ in. (~105 cm) wide and extends 1 ft. 6 in. (~46 cm) into the FIELD.\nThe plane of the opening is at a 14° upward angle relative to the carpet. The\nroof inside the SPEAKER forms a concave surface against which NOTES bounce.  Figure 5‑15 SUBWOOFER  The SUBWOOFER is a 6-faced element centered below each\nSPEAKER and positioned against the ALLIANCE WALL. The SUBWOOFER is 3 ft. 1 in. (~94\ncm) tall and the vertical panels are 8⅜ in. (~21 cm) tall. The SUBWOOFER extends\n3 ft. ⅛ in. (~92 cm) from the ALLIANCE WALL. Vertical faces are black\nHDPE, the side inclined faces are ALLIANCE-colored HDPE, and the center\ninclined panels are vinyl-coated polycarbonate.  Lights indicate if the SPEAKER is AMPLIFIED and if so, how\nmuch AMPLIFICATION time remains. Light strings in the top of the SPEAKER match\nthe ALLIANCE color and turn on if the SPEAKER is AMPLIFIED. ALLIANCE colored lights\nin the SUBWOOFER turn on when AMPLIFICATION starts and recede, second by\nsecond, as AMPLIFICATION progresses, and if AMPLIFICATION ends before the\ncountdown completes (because the maximum number of NOTES have been scored), the\nSUBWOOFER and SPEAKER lights turn off.   5.6.2      DRIVER\nSTATIONS Figure 5‑16 DRIVER STATION (ALLIANCE AREA perspective and FIELD\nperspective)  A DRIVER STATION is 1 of 3\nassemblies within an ALLIANCE WALL behind which a DRIVE TEAM operates their ROBOT.\nEach DRIVER STATION is made from a 3 ft. ¾ in. (~93 cm) tall diamond plate base\ntopped with a 3 ft. 6 in. (~107 cm) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top\nrail. An aluminum shelf is attached to each DRIVER STATION to support an\nOPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is 5 ft. 9 in. (~175 cm) wide and 1 ft. ¼ in. (~31\ncm) deep. There is a 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip\nof hook-and-loop tape (“loop” side) along the center of the support shelf that\nmay be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf.  Each DRIVER STATION contains the following elements for\nDRIVE TEAMS: -      \n1 Ethernet cable: attaches to the Ethernet port of the OPERATOR\nCONSOLE and provides connectivity to the FIELD Management System\n(FMS) -      \n1 120VAC NEMA 5-15R power outlet (i.e. standard US outlet):\nlocated on each DRIVER STATION shelf and protected by its own 2-Amp circuit\nbreaker. It can be used to power the OPERATOR CONSOLE. DRIVE TEAMS are\nresponsible for monitoring their power consumption as a tripped breaker in the\noutlet does not constitute an ARENA FAULT. For some events in regions that\ndon’t use NEMA 5-15 shaped outlets, event organizers may install appropriate\nplug adapters to be used throughout the event.  -      \n1 Emergency Stop (E-Stop) button: located on the left side of the\nDRIVER STATION shelf and is used to deactivate a ROBOT in an emergency  -      \n1 Autonomous Stop (A-Stop) button: located on the right side of\nthe DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to DISABLE a ROBOT during AUTO -      \n1 team sign: located at the top of each DRIVER STATION. The FIELD\nfacing side of the sign displays the team number in the ALLIANCE color. The\nALLIANCE AREA side of the sign displays the following information in red:   o  \nPre-MATCH: team number and ROBOT connection state o  \nDuring the MATCH:  § \nprogress toward RP threshold (n/a during the Playoff Tournament),\n § \ntime remaining in AMPLIFICATION, and § \nremaining MATCH period time. -      \n1 timer (in DRIVER STATION 2 only): displays the official time\nremaining in the MATCH period on the FIELD-facing side (in white) and official\ntime remaining in the MATCH period and MATCH scores on the ALLIANCE AREA facing\nside (in red). -      \n1 team LED stack: indicates ALLIANCE color, ROBOT status, E-Stop and\nA-Stop status, and is centered at the top of each DRIVER STATION.  The stack includes 2 identical ALLIANCE-colored\nROBOT status LEDs above a third amber A-stop/E-stop LED. LED states are as\nfollows:  o  \nROBOT status LEDs § \nSolid: indicates that the ROBOT is connected and enabled. This\nonly happens during a MATCH. § \nBlinking: indicates that either the FMS is preset for the MATCH\nand the ROBOT is not connected yet, or it’s during a MATCH and the\ncorresponding ROBOT is BYPASSED, has lost connectivity, or the E-stop was\npressed. § \nOff: indicates that the ROBOT is linked and DISABLED prior to the\nstart of the MATCH. This light is also off, regardless of ROBOT connection\nstatus, after the MATCH has concluded.  o  \nA-Stop/E-stop LED  § \nSolid: the ROBOT is DISABLED due to a press of the team E-stop\nbutton, the FIELD E-stop button, or by the scorekeeper via the FMS.  § \nBlinking: the ROBOT is DISABLED for the remainder of AUTO due to\na press of the team A-Stop button. § \nOff: the ROBOT is not DISABLED by the FIELD.  -      \nFMS hardware and wiring: mostly located below shelves in the 2\nDRIVER STATIONS closer to the scoring table. 5.7     \nGAME PIECES Figure 5‑17 NOTE  A NOTE is an orange foam torus with a 10 in. (~25\ncm) inside diameter, 1 ft. 2 in. (~36 cm) outside diameter, and 2-in. (~5 cm) thickness.\nA NOTE weighs 8.3 ± 0.2 oz (~235.3 ± 6g). NOTES are available for purchase from\nAndyMark, am-4999.  NOTES undergo wear and tear during a competition. Generally,\na NOTE that still appears to look approximately like a NOTE is considered a\nNOTE for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether damaged or not.\nSmall chunks of a NOTE are not considered a NOTE. A HIGH NOTE is the same size, shape, and\nmaterial as a NOTE but also has 3 equidistant pieces of white gaffers tape that\nwrap around the circular cross-section.  Figure 5‑18 HIGH NOTE  5.8     \nAprilTags AprilTags are 8⅛ in. (~20 cm) square targets located above\nSUBWOOFERS, on SOURCE walls, above AMP walls, and above TRAPS. There are 16\nunique markers on the FIELD, positioned as shown in Figure 5‑19. Figure 5‑19 AprilTag locations  All markers are from the 36h11 tag family, IDs 1-16.\nAprilTags 1-10 are mounted to and centered on a 10½ in. (~27 cm) square\npolycarbonate panel; AprilTags 11-16 are mounted to an aluminum plate. Each\nmarker has an identifying text label. If AprilTags experience wear and marking\nduring MATCHES, they are repaired with gaffers tape. Figure 5‑20 AprilTag sizing (plastic\nmounted, then aluminum mounted)   SOURCE AprilTags (IDs 1, 2,\n9, and 10) are mounted to the SOURCE wall. The bottom of each tag’s panel is 4\nft. ⅛ in.

Printable versions of the markers are\navailable on the 2024 Playing FIELD\nwebpage. 5.9     \nThe FIELD Management System The FIELD Management System (FMS) is\nall the electronics responsible for sensing and controlling the FIRST Robotics\nCompetition FIELD. The FMS encompasses all FIELD electronics, including\ncomputers, REFEREE touchscreens, the wireless access point, sensors,\nstack lights, A-Stops and E-Stops, etc.  When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their\nassigned DRIVER STATION to their OPERATOR CONSOLE, the Driver Station Software\non the OPERATOR CONSOLE computer communicates with FMS. Once connected, the\nopen ports available are described in Table 8‑5. Note that ROBOT code cannot be deployed while connected to\nthe FMS. Additional information about the FMS may be found in the FMS\nWhitepaper. The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using\naudio cues detailed in Table 5‑1. Please note that audio cues are\nintended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH\nmarkers. If there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers,\nthe FIELD timers are the authority.

FIELD\nSTAFF roles are filled by volunteers from the community who prepare for the\nevent with thorough training and certification. There are 3 FIELD-side key\nvolunteer roles with whom teams should be familiar and are encouraged to use as\nresources to make their event experience valuable (in whatever way the team\ndefines “valuable”). ·       \nHead REFEREE – trains, directs, and supervises REFEREES. They\noversee all scoring processes and procedures in collaboration with the FIRST\nTechnical Advisor (FTA). They interact with STUDENTS, volunteers, and\ncontracted/FIRST staff. The Head REFEREE is positioned between the FIELD\nand the scoring table and wears a yellow shirt. The Head REFEREE has final\nauthority for decisions regarding MATCH scores, penalties, and YELLOW and RED\nCARD assignments. For additional details, please refer to the Head\nREFEREE role description.  ·       \nFIRST Technical Advisor (FTA) - ensures events run\nsmoothly, safely, and in accordance with FIRST requirements. The FTA\ncollaborates with FIRST staff, event staff, and other event volunteers\nin many different areas at events. The FTA is the liaison between FIRST\nHQ and the event for all things related to the FIELD, ROBOTS, and game, acts as\na team advocate for all teams competing at the event, and is a major point of\nescalation and conflict resolution for the event. For additional details,\nplease refer to the FTA\nrole description. ·       \nFIELD Supervisor - directs activity on the FIELD to ensure\nefficient execution of the MATCHES, pacing of the event, and smooth flow of MATCH\nplay. FIELD Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the FIELD is intact and lead\nFIELD Reset teams, who are responsible for resetting the FIELD after each MATCH\nin preparation for the subsequent MATCH.

For some events in regions that\ndon’t use NEMA 5-15 shaped outlets, event organizers may install appropriate\nplug adapters to be used throughout the event.  -      \n1 Emergency Stop (E-Stop) button: located on the left side of the\nDRIVER STATION shelf and is used to deactivate a ROBOT in an emergency  -      \n1 Autonomous Stop (A-Stop) button: located on the right side of\nthe DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to DISABLE a ROBOT during AUTO -      \n1 team sign: located at the top of each DRIVER STATION. The FIELD\nfacing side of the sign displays the team number in the ALLIANCE color. The\nALLIANCE AREA side of the sign displays the following information in red:   o  \nPre-MATCH: team number and ROBOT connection state o  \nDuring the MATCH:  § \nprogress toward RP threshold (n/a during the Playoff Tournament),\n § \ntime remaining in AMPLIFICATION, and § \nremaining MATCH period time. -      \n1 timer (in DRIVER STATION 2 only): displays the official time\nremaining in the MATCH period on the FIELD-facing side (in white) and official\ntime remaining in the MATCH period and MATCH scores on the ALLIANCE AREA facing\nside (in red). -      \n1 team LED stack: indicates ALLIANCE color, ROBOT status, E-Stop and\nA-Stop status, and is centered at the top of each DRIVER STATION.  The stack includes 2 identical ALLIANCE-colored\nROBOT status LEDs above a third amber A-stop/E-stop LED. LED states are as\nfollows:  o  \nROBOT status LEDs § \nSolid: indicates that the ROBOT is connected and enabled. This\nonly happens during a MATCH. § \nBlinking: indicates that either the FMS is preset for the MATCH\nand the ROBOT is not connected yet, or it’s during a MATCH and the\ncorresponding ROBOT is BYPASSED, has lost connectivity, or the E-stop was\npressed. § \nOff: indicates that the ROBOT is linked and DISABLED prior to the\nstart of the MATCH. This light is also off, regardless of ROBOT connection\nstatus, after the MATCH has concluded.  o  \nA-Stop/E-stop LED  § \nSolid: the ROBOT is DISABLED due to a press of the team E-stop\nbutton, the FIELD E-stop button, or by the scorekeeper via the FMS.  § \nBlinking: the ROBOT is DISABLED for the remainder of AUTO due to\na press of the team A-Stop button. § \nOff: the ROBOT is not DISABLED by the FIELD.  -      \nFMS hardware and wiring: mostly located below shelves in the 2\nDRIVER STATIONS closer to the scoring table. 5.7     \nGAME PIECES Figure 5‑17 NOTE  A NOTE is an orange foam torus with a 10 in.

Printable versions of the markers are\navailable on the 2024 Playing FIELD\nwebpage. 5.9     \nThe FIELD Management System The FIELD Management System (FMS) is\nall the electronics responsible for sensing and controlling the FIRST Robotics\nCompetition FIELD. The FMS encompasses all FIELD electronics, including\ncomputers, REFEREE touchscreens, the wireless access point, sensors,\nstack lights, A-Stops and E-Stops, etc.  When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their\nassigned DRIVER STATION to their OPERATOR CONSOLE, the Driver Station Software\non the OPERATOR CONSOLE computer communicates with FMS. Once connected, the\nopen ports available are described in Table 8‑5. Note that ROBOT code cannot be deployed while connected to\nthe FMS. Additional information about the FMS may be found in the FMS\nWhitepaper. The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using\naudio cues detailed in Table 5‑1. Please note that audio cues are\nintended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH\nmarkers. If there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers,\nthe FIELD timers are the authority.

FIELD\nSTAFF roles are filled by volunteers from the community who prepare for the\nevent with thorough training and certification. There are 3 FIELD-side key\nvolunteer roles with whom teams should be familiar and are encouraged to use as\nresources to make their event experience valuable (in whatever way the team\ndefines “valuable”). ·       \nHead REFEREE – trains, directs, and supervises REFEREES. They\noversee all scoring processes and procedures in collaboration with the FIRST\nTechnical Advisor (FTA). They interact with STUDENTS, volunteers, and\ncontracted/FIRST staff. The Head REFEREE is positioned between the FIELD\nand the scoring table and wears a yellow shirt. The Head REFEREE has final\nauthority for decisions regarding MATCH scores, penalties, and YELLOW and RED\nCARD assignments. For additional details, please refer to the Head\nREFEREE role description.  ·       \nFIRST Technical Advisor (FTA) - ensures events run\nsmoothly, safely, and in accordance with FIRST requirements. The FTA\ncollaborates with FIRST staff, event staff, and other event volunteers\nin many different areas at events. The FTA is the liaison between FIRST\nHQ and the event for all things related to the FIELD, ROBOTS, and game, acts as\na team advocate for all teams competing at the event, and is a major point of\nescalation and conflict resolution for the event. For additional details,\nplease refer to the FTA\nrole description. ·       \nFIELD Supervisor - directs activity on the FIELD to ensure\nefficient execution of the MATCHES, pacing of the event, and smooth flow of MATCH\nplay. FIELD Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the FIELD is intact and lead\nFIELD Reset teams, who are responsible for resetting the FIELD after each MATCH\nin preparation for the subsequent MATCH.

(~25\ncm) inside diameter, 1 ft. 2 in. (~36 cm) outside diameter, and 2-in. (~5 cm) thickness.\nA NOTE weighs 8.3 ± 0.2 oz (~235.3 ± 6g). NOTES are available for purchase from\nAndyMark, am-4999.  NOTES undergo wear and tear during a competition. Generally,\na NOTE that still appears to look approximately like a NOTE is considered a\nNOTE for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether damaged or not.\nSmall chunks of a NOTE are not considered a NOTE. A HIGH NOTE is the same size, shape, and\nmaterial as a NOTE but also has 3 equidistant pieces of white gaffers tape that\nwrap around the circular cross-section.  Figure 5‑18 HIGH NOTE  5.8     \nAprilTags AprilTags are 8⅛ in. (~20 cm) square targets located above\nSUBWOOFERS, on SOURCE walls, above AMP walls, and above TRAPS. There are 16\nunique markers on the FIELD, positioned as shown in Figure 5‑19. Figure 5‑19 AprilTag locations  All markers are from the 36h11 tag family, IDs 1-16.\nAprilTags 1-10 are mounted to and centered on a 10½ in. (~27 cm) square\npolycarbonate panel; AprilTags 11-16 are mounted to an aluminum plate. Each\nmarker has an identifying text label. If AprilTags experience wear and marking\nduring MATCHES, they are repaired with gaffers tape. Figure 5‑20 AprilTag sizing (plastic\nmounted, then aluminum mounted)   SOURCE AprilTags (IDs 1, 2,\n9, and 10) are mounted to the SOURCE wall. The bottom of each tag’s panel is 4\nft. ⅛ in.

Printable versions of the markers are\navailable on the 2024 Playing FIELD\nwebpage. 5.9     \nThe FIELD Management System The FIELD Management System (FMS) is\nall the electronics responsible for sensing and controlling the FIRST Robotics\nCompetition FIELD. The FMS encompasses all FIELD electronics, including\ncomputers, REFEREE touchscreens, the wireless access point, sensors,\nstack lights, A-Stops and E-Stops, etc.  When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their\nassigned DRIVER STATION to their OPERATOR CONSOLE, the Driver Station Software\non the OPERATOR CONSOLE computer communicates with FMS. Once connected, the\nopen ports available are described in Table 8‑5. Note that ROBOT code cannot be deployed while connected to\nthe FMS. Additional information about the FMS may be found in the FMS\nWhitepaper. The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using\naudio cues detailed in Table 5‑1. Please note that audio cues are\nintended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH\nmarkers. If there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers,\nthe FIELD timers are the authority.

FIELD\nSTAFF roles are filled by volunteers from the community who prepare for the\nevent with thorough training and certification. There are 3 FIELD-side key\nvolunteer roles with whom teams should be familiar and are encouraged to use as\nresources to make their event experience valuable (in whatever way the team\ndefines “valuable”). ·       \nHead REFEREE – trains, directs, and supervises REFEREES. They\noversee all scoring processes and procedures in collaboration with the FIRST\nTechnical Advisor (FTA). They interact with STUDENTS, volunteers, and\ncontracted/FIRST staff. The Head REFEREE is positioned between the FIELD\nand the scoring table and wears a yellow shirt. The Head REFEREE has final\nauthority for decisions regarding MATCH scores, penalties, and YELLOW and RED\nCARD assignments. For additional details, please refer to the Head\nREFEREE role description.  ·       \nFIRST Technical Advisor (FTA) - ensures events run\nsmoothly, safely, and in accordance with FIRST requirements. The FTA\ncollaborates with FIRST staff, event staff, and other event volunteers\nin many different areas at events. The FTA is the liaison between FIRST\nHQ and the event for all things related to the FIELD, ROBOTS, and game, acts as\na team advocate for all teams competing at the event, and is a major point of\nescalation and conflict resolution for the event. For additional details,\nplease refer to the FTA\nrole description. ·       \nFIELD Supervisor - directs activity on the FIELD to ensure\nefficient execution of the MATCHES, pacing of the event, and smooth flow of MATCH\nplay. FIELD Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the FIELD is intact and lead\nFIELD Reset teams, who are responsible for resetting the FIELD after each MATCH\nin preparation for the subsequent MATCH.

Additional information about the FMS may be found in the FMS\nWhitepaper. The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using\naudio cues detailed in Table 5‑1. Please note that audio cues are\nintended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH\nmarkers. If there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers,\nthe FIELD timers are the authority.

The FMS encompasses all FIELD electronics, including\ncomputers, REFEREE touchscreens, the wireless access point, sensors,\nstack lights, A-Stops and E-Stops, etc.  When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their\nassigned DRIVER STATION to their OPERATOR CONSOLE, the Driver Station Software\non the OPERATOR CONSOLE computer communicates with FMS. Once connected, the\nopen ports available are described in Table 8‑5. Note that ROBOT code cannot be deployed while connected to\nthe FMS. Additional information about the FMS may be found in the FMS\nWhitepaper. The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using\naudio cues detailed in Table 5‑1. Please note that audio cues are\nintended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH\nmarkers. If there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers,\nthe FIELD timers are the authority.

During the MATCH, ROBOTS score NOTES in their SPEAKER or\nAMP. HUMAN PLAYERS use NOTES scored through the AMP to AMPLIFY the points\nassociated with NOTES scored in their SPEAKER for 10 seconds at a time or\nengage in Coopertition with their opponents.  ROBOTS conclude the MATCH PARKING in their STAGE ZONE, getting\nONSTAGE via a chain, and/or scoring a NOTE in a TRAP. Additional points are awarded if an ALLIANCE HARMONIZES\n(i.e. more than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE via the same chain) and if\nHUMAN PLAYERS SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS (i.e. score a HIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE to increase\npoints awarded for those ONSTAGE ROBOTS).   6.2      DRIVE\nTEAM A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people\nfrom the same FIRST Robotics Competition team responsible for team\nperformance for a specific MATCH. There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE\nTEAM which ALLIANCES can use to assist ROBOTS with CRESCENDO, and no more than\n1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a non-STUDENT.

The TECHNICIAN provides teams with a technical resource for\npre-MATCH setup, ROBOT connectivity, OPERATOR CONSOLE troubleshooting, and\npost-MATCH removal of the ROBOT. Some pre-MATCH responsibilities for the\nTECHNICIAN may include, but are not limited to: -      \nlocation of the ROBOT radio, its power connection, and\nunderstanding of its indicator lights -      \nlocation of the roboRIO and understanding of its indicator lights -      \nusername and password for the OPERATOR CONSOLE -      \nrestarting the Driver Station and Dashboard software on the\nOPERATOR CONSOLE -      \nchanging the bandwidth utilization (e.g. camera resolution, frame\nrate, etc.) -      \nchanging a battery -      \ncharging pneumatics If an ALLIANCE does not have at least 2 HUMAN PLAYERS, 1 of\nthe ALLIANCE’S teams may substitute a STUDENT TECHNICIAN as a HUMAN PLAYER for\nthat MATCH only. In this case, -      \nthe Head REFEREE must be notified, -      \nall HUMAN PLAYER rules now apply to this DRIVE TEAM member, and -      \nthis DRIVE TEAM member is no longer considered a TECHNICIAN for\nthat MATCH. 6.3     \nSetup Before each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage GAME PIECES as\ndescribed in Section 6.3.4 GAME PIECES. DRIVE TEAMS\nstage their ROBOTS (as described in Section 6.3.3 ROBOTS)\nand OPERATOR CONSOLES (as described in Section 6.3.2\nOPERATOR CONSOLES). Then, DRIVE TEAMS take their places as described in Section 6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS. 6.3.1      DRIVE\nTEAMS  DRIVE\nTEAMS prepare for a MATCH by staging in the appropriate areas, according to\ntheir role on the DRIVE TEAM, and by identifying themselves accordingly. DRIVE\nTEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a DRIVE TEAM obstructing or\ndelaying any of the conditions is at risk of violating G301.\n A.    \nonly DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming MATCH are present, B.    \nonly DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have passed initial, complete\nInspection are present,   C.    \nSOURCE AREA HUMAN PLAYERS are behind the STARTING LINE, D.    \nALLIANCE AREA DRIVE TEAM members are behind the STARTING LINE,  E.    \nTECHNICIANS are in the event-designated area near the FIELD, F.    \nDRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above their\nwaists (COACH - “Coach”, DRIVERS and HUMAN PLAYERS - “Drive Team”, and TECHNICIAN\n- “Technician”), and G.    \nif a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly displays their\ndesignated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN identifier (e.g. hat or armband). 6.3.2      OPERATOR\nCONSOLES DRIVE TEAMS\nset up their OPERATOR CONSOLE as soon as the DRIVE TEAM from the previous MATCH\nhas cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be compliant with all relevant\nrules, specifically those in Section 8.9 OPERATOR\nCONSOLE. The OPERATOR CONSOLE is plugged into the team’s assigned DRIVER\nSTATION, as indicated on the team sign. Any control devices worn or held by their\nHUMAN PLAYERS and/or DRIVERS during the MATCH must be disconnected from or set\non or beside the OPERATOR CONSOLE before the MATCH can begin. A DRIVE TEAM\nobstructing or delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup is at risk of violating G301. 6.3.3      ROBOTS DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOT in accordance with G303. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying ROBOT setup\nrequirements is at risk of violating G301.  If order of placement matters to either or both ALLIANCES,\nthe ALLIANCE notifies the Head REFEREE during setup for that MATCH, and the\nHead REFEREE instructs ALLIANCES to alternate placement of ROBOTS. In a\nQualification MATCH, REFEREE instructions are that ROBOTS are placed in the\nfollowing order:  1.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 1 ROBOT 2.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT 3.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 2 ROBOT 4.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT 5.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 3 ROBOT 6.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT In an intra-Division Playoff MATCH,\nthe same pattern is applied, but instead of blue ALLIANCE placing last, the\nhigher seeded ALLIANCE (regardless of color) places last. For inter-Division\nPlayoff MATCHES, the ALLIANCE that places last is determined by a (real or\nvirtual) coin flip facilitated by the Head REFEREE where a “heads” result\ninvites the red ALLIANCE to place last.  6.3.4      GAME\nPIECES Before each MATCH\nbegins, FIELD STAFF stage GAME PIECES.  Figure 6‑2 SPIKE MARK locations and GAME PIECE staging positions  3 HIGH NOTES are staged on top of each AMP.  107 NOTES are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference Figure 6‑2):  A.    \n90 NOTES are staged in the SOURCE AREAS (45 NOTES in each SOURCE AREA), B.    \n6 NOTES are staged on WING SPIKE MARKS (3 NOTES in each WING), C.    \n5 NOTES are staged on CENTER LINE SPIKE MARKS,  D.    \n6 NOTES may be preloaded in ROBOTS, 1 per ROBOT, by the ROBOTS’ DRIVE\nTEAMS such that the NOTE is fully supported by the ROBOT. A NOTE not pre-loaded\nin a ROBOT is staged with NOTES in the ALLIANCE’S SOURCE AREA. NOTES on\nSPIKE MARKS are staged such that each NOTE covers the opposite ends of each\nSPIKE MARK. 6.4     \nMATCH Phases The first phase of each MATCH is 15 seconds long and called\nthe Autonomous Period (AUTO). During AUTO, ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE\nTEAM control or input. ROBOTS attempt to score NOTES, exit their ROBOT STARTING\nZONE, and retrieve additional NOTES. There is a 3-second delay between AUTO and\nTELEOP for scoring purposes as described in Section 6.5\nScoring. The second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes\nand 15 seconds (2:15) and called the Teleoperated Period\n(TELEOP). During TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score NOTES\nand take their STAGE. 6.5     \nScoring  ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions\nthrough the course of a MATCH, including leaving their ROBOT STARTING ZONE,\nscoring NOTES in their SPEAKER and AMP, taking their STAGE, SPOTLIGHTING ONSTAGE\nROBOTS by scoring HIGH NOTES, cooperating with their opponents, and winning or\ntying MATCHES. Rewards are granted either via MATCH points, Coopertition\npoints, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, which\nincrease the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH,\nexcept as follows:  A.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 3 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO. B.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 5 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP. C.     assessment\nof STAGE points is made 5 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following\nTELEOP, or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH,\nwhichever happens first. 6.5.1     \nNOTE Scoring Criteria A NOTE is scored in a SPEAKER once it passes through the FIELD-facing\nopening of the SPEAKER and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the AMP once it passes through the\nFIELD-facing opening of the AMP and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the TRAP if it enters the TRAP from\nabove (i.e. through the cutout above the AprilTag). 6.5.2     \nROBOT Scoring Criteria To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS\nmust completely clear its ROBOT STARTING ZONE at any point during AUTO.  To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS must\nbe partially or completely contained in the STAGE ZONE at the end of the MATCH\n(more specifically, per criteria described in item\nC of Section 6.5 Scoring) and does not meet the criteria for ONSTAGE. To qualify for ONSTAGE points, a ROBOT may only be contacting: A.    \ntheir truss legs (pink shaded elements in Figure\n6‑3) via ROBOT BUMPERS, B.    \nGAME PIECES, C.    \nchain-facing vertical surfaces of their core or the nearest flap (with\nregards to the chain used by the ONSTAGE ROBOT, green shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), D.    \ncarpet-facing surfaces of their core (blue shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), and  E.    \na single STAGE chain (on their STAGE) (highlighted in orange in in Figure 6‑3),  F.    \nanother ROBOT qualified for ONSTAGE points,  G.    \na partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G424,\nand H.   \nan opponent ROBOT. Figure 6‑3 Contact points for ONSTAGE\nscoring eligibility  An ALLIANCE achieves HARMONY if more than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE\nvia direct or transitive support from a single chain. HARMONY points, as\nspecified in Table 6‑2 are awarded per additional ROBOT. 6.5.3      AMPLIFICATION AMPLIFICATION increases the number of\nMATCH points awarded for NOTES scored in a SPEAKER per Table\n6‑2. To AMPLIFY, an ALLIANCE must have at least 2 NOTES through their\nAMP. Once this criterion is met, the HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button\nwhich AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that\nSPEAKER, whichever comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening\nto the sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal\nAMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER within 10\nseconds of the AMP button being pressed but haven’t yet been processed. An\nALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION\nends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered\nthrough the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do\nnot contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or Coopertition requirement,\nthey do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only “bank” up to 2\nNOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or Cooperition).  6.5.4     \nSPOTLIGHTING ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring a\nHIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE. A HIGH NOTE is scored on the MICROPHONE if the\nNOTE surrounds, i.e. encircles, the MICROPHONE. Once a HIGH NOTE is scored on a\nMICROPHONE, ONSTAGE ROBOTS paired with (i.e. below) the MICROPHONE on which the\nHIGH NOTE was scored are awarded a greater number of points per Table 6‑2. 6.5.5     \nCoopertition Bonus If both ALLIANCES use a NOTE scored in their AMP to engage\nin Coopertition (by pressing their Coopertition button) within\nthe first 45 seconds of TELEOP (i.e. remaining MATCH time is greater than 1:30),\nall teams earn a Coopertition Bonus, and the threshold for the MELODY\ndecreases as described in Table 6‑2. A NOTE used for Coopertition is no longer eligible\nfor contribution to AMPLIFICATION. See Section 10.5.3\nQualification Ranking for more information about Coopertition influence\non Qualification Ranking order.

The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a\nRED CARD for egregious behavior inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics\nCompetition event. A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE\nholding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air while the Game Announcer describes\nthe violation. YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD\nis automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any\nsubsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including\nearning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is\nindicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air\nsimultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received\neither a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent\nMATCHES, except as noted below.  Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, its team number\nis presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning\nof all subsequent MATCHES, including any replays, as a reminder to the team,\nthe REFEREES, and the audience that they carry a YELLOW CARD. Figure 6‑4 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD\nindicators  All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of\nPractice, Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. Verbal warnings are\ncleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES through\nsubsequent tournament phases. The Head REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a verbal\nwarning or YELLOW CARD earned during Practice MATCHES through to Qualification\nMATCHES for particularly egregious behavior.  6.6.2     \nYELLOW and RED CARD application YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following: Table 6‑4 YELLOW and RED CARD application \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:\n   \n   \n   MATCH\n   to which CARD is applied:\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  prior to Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Practice MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH.\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of PRACTICE\n  MATCHES and the start of Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Qualification MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH. In the case where the team participated as a SURROGATE\n  in the current (or just completed) MATCH, the card is applied to the team’s\n  previous MATCH (i.e. the team’s second Qualification MATCH)\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of\n  Qualification MATCHES and the start of Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S first Playoff MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH \n  \n \n\n\n 6.6.3     \nYELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to\nthe violating team’s entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team. If\nan ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD\nwhich results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES\nreceive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically,\nis DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH. 6.6.4      Violation\nDetails There are several styles of violation wording used in this\nmanual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the\nviolation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible\nviolations, but rather a representative set of combinations. Table 6‑5 Violation examples \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Example\n   Violation\n   \n   \n   Expanded Interpretation\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH FOUL and YELLOW\n  CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is assessed against the\n  violating ALLIANCE. After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating\n  team with a YELLOW CARD.\n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  per additional NOTE. If egregious, YELLOW CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a number of FOULS\n  are assessed against the violating ALLIANCE equal to the number of additional\n  NOTES beyond the permitted quantity. Additionally, if the REFEREES determine\n  that the action was egregious, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team\n  with a YELLOW CARD after the MATCH. \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL, PLUS TECH\n  FOUL IF REPEATED\n  \n  \n  Upon initial violation in a MATCH, a FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. If the ALLIANCE ROBOT repeats the infraction\n  in the MATCH, a FOUL and a TECH FOUL are assessed against the violating\n  ALLIANCE. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that ROBOT in\n  that MATCH, the ROBOT has “earned” 2 FOULS and a TECH FOUL for their\n  ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH\n  FOUL, and for every 5 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a TECH\n  FOUL is assessed\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE and the REFEREE begins to count.\n  Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met,\n  and for each 5 seconds within that time, an additional TECH FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. A ROBOT in violation of this type of rule for\n  15 seconds receives a total of 4 TECH FOULS (assuming no other rules were\n  being simultaneously violated).\n  \n \n \n  \n  RED CARD for the\n  ALLIANCE\n  \n  \n  After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating ALLIANCE\n  with a RED CARD in the following fashion:\n  In a PLAYOFF MATCH, a single RED CARD is assessed to the ALLIANCE.\n  In all other scenarios, each team on the ALLIANCE is\n  issued a RED CARD.\n  \n \n\n\n 6.7      Head\nREFEREE and FTA Interaction The Head REFEREE has the ultimate authority in the ARENA\nduring the event, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game\nDesigners, FIRST personnel, FTA, and other event staff. The Head REFEREE\nrulings are final. No event staff, including the Head REFEREE, will review\nvideo, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any MATCH, from any source, under\nany circumstances. 6.7.1      Question\nBox Each ALLIANCE has a designated Question Box near the scoring\ntable. If a DRIVE TEAM has a question about a MATCH, the FIELD, etc., they may\nsend 1 DRIVE TEAM member to their corresponding Question Box. Depending on\ntiming, the Head REFEREE or FTA may postpone any requested discussion until the\nend of the subsequent MATCH. Technical questions regarding FIELD or ROBOT operation are\naddressed by the FTA, and additional team members are invited to participate in\nthese conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a\nruling or score, per Q101, 1 STUDENT from that DRIVE TEAM\nshould address the Head REFEREE after the ARENA Reset Signal (e.g. FIELD lights\nturn green). While FMS tracks quantities of FOULS, FIRST instructs\nREFEREES to not self-track details about FOULS and TECH FOULS; as a result, we\ndon’t expect REFEREES to recall details about what FOULS and TECH FOULS were\nmade, when they occurred, and against whom.","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144163\"></a><a name=\"_Setup\"></a>6.1<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>MATCH Overview</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">MATCHES run on 7–10-minute cycles, which consist of pre-MATCH\nsetup, <a name=\"MATCH\">the 2-minute and 30-second </a>MATCH, and the post-MATCH\nreset.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the MATCH, ROBOTS score NOTES in their SPEAKER or\nAMP.

The intent is not to allow\nteams to “adopt” members of other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning\nteam, borrowing team, and/or their ALLIANCE (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes\n1 of their DRIVERS has more experience than a DRIVER on their first pick, and\nthe teams agree the first pick team will “adopt” that DRIVER and make them a\nmember of their DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\"><span style=\"color:black\">The definition isn’t stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to\navoid additional bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g.\nrequiring that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check before\nallowing a DRIVE TEAM into the ARENA). Second, to provide space for exceptional\ncircumstances that give teams the opportunity to display <i>Gracious\nProfessionalism</i> (e.g. a bus is delayed, a COACH has no DRIVERS, and their\npit neighbors agree to help by loaning DRIVERS as temporary members of the team\nuntil their bus arrives).</span></p>\n\n</div><p class=\"MsoCaption\" align=\"center\"

DRIVE\nTEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a DRIVE TEAM obstructing or\ndelaying any of the conditions is at risk of violating G301.\n A.    \nonly DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming MATCH are present, B.    \nonly DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have passed initial, complete\nInspection are present,   C.    \nSOURCE AREA HUMAN PLAYERS are behind the STARTING LINE, D.    \nALLIANCE AREA DRIVE TEAM members are behind the STARTING LINE,  E.    \nTECHNICIANS are in the event-designated area near the FIELD, F.    \nDRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above their\nwaists (COACH - “Coach”, DRIVERS and HUMAN PLAYERS - “Drive Team”, and TECHNICIAN\n- “Technician”), and G.    \nif a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly displays their\ndesignated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN identifier (e.g. hat or armband). 6.3.2      OPERATOR\nCONSOLES DRIVE TEAMS\nset up their OPERATOR CONSOLE as soon as the DRIVE TEAM from the previous MATCH\nhas cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be compliant with all relevant\nrules, specifically those in Section 8.9 OPERATOR\nCONSOLE. The OPERATOR CONSOLE is plugged into the team’s assigned DRIVER\nSTATION, as indicated on the team sign. Any control devices worn or held by their\nHUMAN PLAYERS and/or DRIVERS during the MATCH must be disconnected from or set\non or beside the OPERATOR CONSOLE before the MATCH can begin. A DRIVE TEAM\nobstructing or delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup is at risk of violating G301. 6.3.3      ROBOTS DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOT in accordance with G303. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying ROBOT setup\nrequirements is at risk of violating G301.  If order of placement matters to either or both ALLIANCES,\nthe ALLIANCE notifies the Head REFEREE during setup for that MATCH, and the\nHead REFEREE instructs ALLIANCES to alternate placement of ROBOTS. In a\nQualification MATCH, REFEREE instructions are that ROBOTS are placed in the\nfollowing order:  1.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 1 ROBOT 2.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT 3.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 2 ROBOT 4.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT 5.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 3 ROBOT 6.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT In an intra-Division Playoff MATCH,\nthe same pattern is applied, but instead of blue ALLIANCE placing last, the\nhigher seeded ALLIANCE (regardless of color) places last. For inter-Division\nPlayoff MATCHES, the ALLIANCE that places last is determined by a (real or\nvirtual) coin flip facilitated by the Head REFEREE where a “heads” result\ninvites the red ALLIANCE to place last.  6.3.4      GAME\nPIECES Before each MATCH\nbegins, FIELD STAFF stage GAME PIECES.  Figure 6‑2 SPIKE MARK locations and GAME PIECE staging positions  3 HIGH NOTES are staged on top of each AMP.  107 NOTES are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference Figure 6‑2):  A.    \n90 NOTES are staged in the SOURCE AREAS (45 NOTES in each SOURCE AREA), B.    \n6 NOTES are staged on WING SPIKE MARKS (3 NOTES in each WING), C.    \n5 NOTES are staged on CENTER LINE SPIKE MARKS,  D.    \n6 NOTES may be preloaded in ROBOTS, 1 per ROBOT, by the ROBOTS’ DRIVE\nTEAMS such that the NOTE is fully supported by the ROBOT. A NOTE not pre-loaded\nin a ROBOT is staged with NOTES in the ALLIANCE’S SOURCE AREA. NOTES on\nSPIKE MARKS are staged such that each NOTE covers the opposite ends of each\nSPIKE MARK. 6.4     \nMATCH Phases The first phase of each MATCH is 15 seconds long and called\nthe Autonomous Period (AUTO). During AUTO, ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE\nTEAM control or input. ROBOTS attempt to score NOTES, exit their ROBOT STARTING\nZONE, and retrieve additional NOTES. There is a 3-second delay between AUTO and\nTELEOP for scoring purposes as described in Section 6.5\nScoring. The second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes\nand 15 seconds (2:15) and called the Teleoperated Period\n(TELEOP). During TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score NOTES\nand take their STAGE. 6.5     \nScoring  ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions\nthrough the course of a MATCH, including leaving their ROBOT STARTING ZONE,\nscoring NOTES in their SPEAKER and AMP, taking their STAGE, SPOTLIGHTING ONSTAGE\nROBOTS by scoring HIGH NOTES, cooperating with their opponents, and winning or\ntying MATCHES. Rewards are granted either via MATCH points, Coopertition\npoints, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, which\nincrease the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH,\nexcept as follows:  A.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 3 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO. B.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 5 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP. C.     assessment\nof STAGE points is made 5 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following\nTELEOP, or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH,\nwhichever happens first. 6.5.1     \nNOTE Scoring Criteria A NOTE is scored in a SPEAKER once it passes through the FIELD-facing\nopening of the SPEAKER and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the AMP once it passes through the\nFIELD-facing opening of the AMP and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the TRAP if it enters the TRAP from\nabove (i.e. through the cutout above the AprilTag). 6.5.2     \nROBOT Scoring Criteria To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS\nmust completely clear its ROBOT STARTING ZONE at any point during AUTO.  To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS must\nbe partially or completely contained in the STAGE ZONE at the end of the MATCH\n(more specifically, per criteria described in item\nC of Section 6.5 Scoring) and does not meet the criteria for ONSTAGE. To qualify for ONSTAGE points, a ROBOT may only be contacting: A.    \ntheir truss legs (pink shaded elements in Figure\n6‑3) via ROBOT BUMPERS, B.    \nGAME PIECES, C.    \nchain-facing vertical surfaces of their core or the nearest flap (with\nregards to the chain used by the ONSTAGE ROBOT, green shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), D.    \ncarpet-facing surfaces of their core (blue shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), and  E.    \na single STAGE chain (on their STAGE) (highlighted in orange in in Figure 6‑3),  F.    \nanother ROBOT qualified for ONSTAGE points,  G.    \na partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G424,\nand H.   \nan opponent ROBOT. Figure 6‑3 Contact points for ONSTAGE\nscoring eligibility  An ALLIANCE achieves HARMONY if more than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE\nvia direct or transitive support from a single chain. HARMONY points, as\nspecified in Table 6‑2 are awarded per additional ROBOT. 6.5.3      AMPLIFICATION AMPLIFICATION increases the number of\nMATCH points awarded for NOTES scored in a SPEAKER per Table\n6‑2. To AMPLIFY, an ALLIANCE must have at least 2 NOTES through their\nAMP. Once this criterion is met, the HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button\nwhich AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that\nSPEAKER, whichever comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening\nto the sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal\nAMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER within 10\nseconds of the AMP button being pressed but haven’t yet been processed. An\nALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION\nends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered\nthrough the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do\nnot contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or Coopertition requirement,\nthey do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only “bank” up to 2\nNOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or Cooperition).  6.5.4     \nSPOTLIGHTING ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring a\nHIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE. A HIGH NOTE is scored on the MICROPHONE if the\nNOTE surrounds, i.e. encircles, the MICROPHONE. Once a HIGH NOTE is scored on a\nMICROPHONE, ONSTAGE ROBOTS paired with (i.e. below) the MICROPHONE on which the\nHIGH NOTE was scored are awarded a greater number of points per Table 6‑2. 6.5.5     \nCoopertition Bonus If both ALLIANCES use a NOTE scored in their AMP to engage\nin Coopertition (by pressing their Coopertition button) within\nthe first 45 seconds of TELEOP (i.e. remaining MATCH time is greater than 1:30),\nall teams earn a Coopertition Bonus, and the threshold for the MELODY\ndecreases as described in Table 6‑2. A NOTE used for Coopertition is no longer eligible\nfor contribution to AMPLIFICATION. See Section 10.5.3\nQualification Ranking for more information about Coopertition influence\non Qualification Ranking order. In Playoff MATCHES, the Coopertition button is\nunused.  6.5.6     \nPoint Values Point values for tasks in CRESCENDO are detailed in Table 6‑2.

The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a\nRED CARD for egregious behavior inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics\nCompetition event. A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE\nholding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air while the Game Announcer describes\nthe violation. YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD\nis automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any\nsubsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including\nearning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is\nindicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air\nsimultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received\neither a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent\nMATCHES, except as noted below.  Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, its team number\nis presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning\nof all subsequent MATCHES, including any replays, as a reminder to the team,\nthe REFEREES, and the audience that they carry a YELLOW CARD. Figure 6‑4 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD\nindicators  All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of\nPractice, Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. Verbal warnings are\ncleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES through\nsubsequent tournament phases. The Head REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a verbal\nwarning or YELLOW CARD earned during Practice MATCHES through to Qualification\nMATCHES for particularly egregious behavior.  6.6.2     \nYELLOW and RED CARD application YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following: Table 6‑4 YELLOW and RED CARD application \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:\n   \n   \n   MATCH\n   to which CARD is applied:\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  prior to Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Practice MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH.\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of PRACTICE\n  MATCHES and the start of Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Qualification MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH. In the case where the team participated as a SURROGATE\n  in the current (or just completed) MATCH, the card is applied to the team’s\n  previous MATCH (i.e. the team’s second Qualification MATCH)\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of\n  Qualification MATCHES and the start of Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S first Playoff MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH \n  \n \n\n\n 6.6.3     \nYELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to\nthe violating team’s entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team. If\nan ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD\nwhich results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES\nreceive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically,\nis DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH. 6.6.4      Violation\nDetails There are several styles of violation wording used in this\nmanual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the\nviolation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible\nviolations, but rather a representative set of combinations. Table 6‑5 Violation examples \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Example\n   Violation\n   \n   \n   Expanded Interpretation\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH FOUL and YELLOW\n  CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is assessed against the\n  violating ALLIANCE. After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating\n  team with a YELLOW CARD.\n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  per additional NOTE. If egregious, YELLOW CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a number of FOULS\n  are assessed against the violating ALLIANCE equal to the number of additional\n  NOTES beyond the permitted quantity. Additionally, if the REFEREES determine\n  that the action was egregious, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team\n  with a YELLOW CARD after the MATCH. \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL, PLUS TECH\n  FOUL IF REPEATED\n  \n  \n  Upon initial violation in a MATCH, a FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. If the ALLIANCE ROBOT repeats the infraction\n  in the MATCH, a FOUL and a TECH FOUL are assessed against the violating\n  ALLIANCE. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that ROBOT in\n  that MATCH, the ROBOT has “earned” 2 FOULS and a TECH FOUL for their\n  ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH\n  FOUL, and for every 5 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a TECH\n  FOUL is assessed\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE and the REFEREE begins to count.\n  Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met,\n  and for each 5 seconds within that time, an additional TECH FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. A ROBOT in violation of this type of rule for\n  15 seconds receives a total of 4 TECH FOULS (assuming no other rules were\n  being simultaneously violated).\n  \n \n \n  \n  RED CARD for the\n  ALLIANCE\n  \n  \n  After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating ALLIANCE\n  with a RED CARD in the following fashion:\n  In a PLAYOFF MATCH, a single RED CARD is assessed to the ALLIANCE.\n  In all other scenarios, each team on the ALLIANCE is\n  issued a RED CARD.\n  \n \n\n\n 6.7      Head\nREFEREE and FTA Interaction The Head REFEREE has the ultimate authority in the ARENA\nduring the event, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game\nDesigners, FIRST personnel, FTA, and other event staff. The Head REFEREE\nrulings are final. No event staff, including the Head REFEREE, will review\nvideo, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any MATCH, from any source, under\nany circumstances. 6.7.1      Question\nBox Each ALLIANCE has a designated Question Box near the scoring\ntable. If a DRIVE TEAM has a question about a MATCH, the FIELD, etc., they may\nsend 1 DRIVE TEAM member to their corresponding Question Box. Depending on\ntiming, the Head REFEREE or FTA may postpone any requested discussion until the\nend of the subsequent MATCH. Technical questions regarding FIELD or ROBOT operation are\naddressed by the FTA, and additional team members are invited to participate in\nthese conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a\nruling or score, per Q101, 1 STUDENT from that DRIVE TEAM\nshould address the Head REFEREE after the ARENA Reset Signal (e.g. FIELD lights\nturn green). While FMS tracks quantities of FOULS, FIRST instructs\nREFEREES to not self-track details about FOULS and TECH FOULS; as a result, we\ndon’t expect REFEREES to recall details about what FOULS and TECH FOULS were\nmade, when they occurred, and against whom.","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144164\"></a><a name=\"_DRIVE_TEAM_1\"></a>6.2<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DRIVE\nTEAM</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A DRIVE TEAM is <a name=\"DRIVE_TEAM\">a set of up to 5 people\nfrom the same <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition team responsible for team\nperformance for a specific MATCH</a>.

The intent is not to allow\nteams to “adopt” members of other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning\nteam, borrowing team, and/or their ALLIANCE (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes\n1 of their DRIVERS has more experience than a DRIVER on their first pick, and\nthe teams agree the first pick team will “adopt” that DRIVER and make them a\nmember of their DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\"><span style=\"color:black\">The definition isn’t stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to\navoid additional bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g.\nrequiring that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check before\nallowing a DRIVE TEAM into the ARENA). Second, to provide space for exceptional\ncircumstances that give teams the opportunity to display <i>Gracious\nProfessionalism</i> (e.g. a bus is delayed, a COACH has no DRIVERS, and their\npit neighbors agree to help by loaning DRIVERS as temporary members of the team\nuntil their bus arrives).</span></p>\n\n</div><p class=\"MsoCaption\" align=\"center\"

In a\nQualification MATCH, REFEREE instructions are that ROBOTS are placed in the\nfollowing order:  1.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 1 ROBOT 2.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT 3.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 2 ROBOT 4.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT 5.     red DRIVER\nSTATION 3 ROBOT 6.     blue\nDRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT In an intra-Division Playoff MATCH,\nthe same pattern is applied, but instead of blue ALLIANCE placing last, the\nhigher seeded ALLIANCE (regardless of color) places last. For inter-Division\nPlayoff MATCHES, the ALLIANCE that places last is determined by a (real or\nvirtual) coin flip facilitated by the Head REFEREE where a “heads” result\ninvites the red ALLIANCE to place last.  6.3.4      GAME\nPIECES Before each MATCH\nbegins, FIELD STAFF stage GAME PIECES.  Figure 6‑2 SPIKE MARK locations and GAME PIECE staging positions  3 HIGH NOTES are staged on top of each AMP.  107 NOTES are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference Figure 6‑2):  A.    \n90 NOTES are staged in the SOURCE AREAS (45 NOTES in each SOURCE AREA), B.    \n6 NOTES are staged on WING SPIKE MARKS (3 NOTES in each WING), C.    \n5 NOTES are staged on CENTER LINE SPIKE MARKS,  D.    \n6 NOTES may be preloaded in ROBOTS, 1 per ROBOT, by the ROBOTS’ DRIVE\nTEAMS such that the NOTE is fully supported by the ROBOT. A NOTE not pre-loaded\nin a ROBOT is staged with NOTES in the ALLIANCE’S SOURCE AREA. NOTES on\nSPIKE MARKS are staged such that each NOTE covers the opposite ends of each\nSPIKE MARK. 6.4     \nMATCH Phases The first phase of each MATCH is 15 seconds long and called\nthe Autonomous Period (AUTO). During AUTO, ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE\nTEAM control or input. ROBOTS attempt to score NOTES, exit their ROBOT STARTING\nZONE, and retrieve additional NOTES. There is a 3-second delay between AUTO and\nTELEOP for scoring purposes as described in Section 6.5\nScoring. The second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes\nand 15 seconds (2:15) and called the Teleoperated Period\n(TELEOP). During TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score NOTES\nand take their STAGE. 6.5     \nScoring  ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions\nthrough the course of a MATCH, including leaving their ROBOT STARTING ZONE,\nscoring NOTES in their SPEAKER and AMP, taking their STAGE, SPOTLIGHTING ONSTAGE\nROBOTS by scoring HIGH NOTES, cooperating with their opponents, and winning or\ntying MATCHES. Rewards are granted either via MATCH points, Coopertition\npoints, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, which\nincrease the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH,\nexcept as follows:  A.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 3 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO. B.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 5 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP. C.     assessment\nof STAGE points is made 5 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following\nTELEOP, or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH,\nwhichever happens first. 6.5.1     \nNOTE Scoring Criteria A NOTE is scored in a SPEAKER once it passes through the FIELD-facing\nopening of the SPEAKER and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the AMP once it passes through the\nFIELD-facing opening of the AMP and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the TRAP if it enters the TRAP from\nabove (i.e. through the cutout above the AprilTag). 6.5.2     \nROBOT Scoring Criteria To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS\nmust completely clear its ROBOT STARTING ZONE at any point during AUTO.  To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS must\nbe partially or completely contained in the STAGE ZONE at the end of the MATCH\n(more specifically, per criteria described in item\nC of Section 6.5 Scoring) and does not meet the criteria for ONSTAGE. To qualify for ONSTAGE points, a ROBOT may only be contacting: A.    \ntheir truss legs (pink shaded elements in Figure\n6‑3) via ROBOT BUMPERS, B.    \nGAME PIECES, C.    \nchain-facing vertical surfaces of their core or the nearest flap (with\nregards to the chain used by the ONSTAGE ROBOT, green shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), D.    \ncarpet-facing surfaces of their core (blue shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), and  E.    \na single STAGE chain (on their STAGE) (highlighted in orange in in Figure 6‑3),  F.    \nanother ROBOT qualified for ONSTAGE points,  G.    \na partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G424,\nand H.   \nan opponent ROBOT. Figure 6‑3 Contact points for ONSTAGE\nscoring eligibility  An ALLIANCE achieves HARMONY if more than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE\nvia direct or transitive support from a single chain. HARMONY points, as\nspecified in Table 6‑2 are awarded per additional ROBOT. 6.5.3      AMPLIFICATION AMPLIFICATION increases the number of\nMATCH points awarded for NOTES scored in a SPEAKER per Table\n6‑2. To AMPLIFY, an ALLIANCE must have at least 2 NOTES through their\nAMP. Once this criterion is met, the HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button\nwhich AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that\nSPEAKER, whichever comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening\nto the sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal\nAMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER within 10\nseconds of the AMP button being pressed but haven’t yet been processed. An\nALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION\nends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered\nthrough the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do\nnot contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or Coopertition requirement,\nthey do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only “bank” up to 2\nNOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or Cooperition).  6.5.4     \nSPOTLIGHTING ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring a\nHIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE. A HIGH NOTE is scored on the MICROPHONE if the\nNOTE surrounds, i.e. encircles, the MICROPHONE. Once a HIGH NOTE is scored on a\nMICROPHONE, ONSTAGE ROBOTS paired with (i.e. below) the MICROPHONE on which the\nHIGH NOTE was scored are awarded a greater number of points per Table 6‑2. 6.5.5     \nCoopertition Bonus If both ALLIANCES use a NOTE scored in their AMP to engage\nin Coopertition (by pressing their Coopertition button) within\nthe first 45 seconds of TELEOP (i.e. remaining MATCH time is greater than 1:30),\nall teams earn a Coopertition Bonus, and the threshold for the MELODY\ndecreases as described in Table 6‑2. A NOTE used for Coopertition is no longer eligible\nfor contribution to AMPLIFICATION. See Section 10.5.3\nQualification Ranking for more information about Coopertition influence\non Qualification Ranking order. In Playoff MATCHES, the Coopertition button is\nunused.  6.5.6     \nPoint Values Point values for tasks in CRESCENDO are detailed in Table 6‑2.

The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a\nRED CARD for egregious behavior inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics\nCompetition event. A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE\nholding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air while the Game Announcer describes\nthe violation. YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD\nis automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any\nsubsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including\nearning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is\nindicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air\nsimultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received\neither a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent\nMATCHES, except as noted below.  Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, its team number\nis presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning\nof all subsequent MATCHES, including any replays, as a reminder to the team,\nthe REFEREES, and the audience that they carry a YELLOW CARD. Figure 6‑4 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD\nindicators  All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of\nPractice, Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. Verbal warnings are\ncleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES through\nsubsequent tournament phases. The Head REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a verbal\nwarning or YELLOW CARD earned during Practice MATCHES through to Qualification\nMATCHES for particularly egregious behavior.  6.6.2     \nYELLOW and RED CARD application YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following: Table 6‑4 YELLOW and RED CARD application \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:\n   \n   \n   MATCH\n   to which CARD is applied:\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  prior to Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Practice MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH.\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of PRACTICE\n  MATCHES and the start of Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Qualification MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH. In the case where the team participated as a SURROGATE\n  in the current (or just completed) MATCH, the card is applied to the team’s\n  previous MATCH (i.e. the team’s second Qualification MATCH)\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of\n  Qualification MATCHES and the start of Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S first Playoff MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH \n  \n \n\n\n 6.6.3     \nYELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to\nthe violating team’s entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team. If\nan ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD\nwhich results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES\nreceive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically,\nis DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH. 6.6.4      Violation\nDetails There are several styles of violation wording used in this\nmanual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the\nviolation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible\nviolations, but rather a representative set of combinations. Table 6‑5 Violation examples \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Example\n   Violation\n   \n   \n   Expanded Interpretation\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH FOUL and YELLOW\n  CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is assessed against the\n  violating ALLIANCE. After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating\n  team with a YELLOW CARD.\n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  per additional NOTE. If egregious, YELLOW CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a number of FOULS\n  are assessed against the violating ALLIANCE equal to the number of additional\n  NOTES beyond the permitted quantity. Additionally, if the REFEREES determine\n  that the action was egregious, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team\n  with a YELLOW CARD after the MATCH. \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL, PLUS TECH\n  FOUL IF REPEATED\n  \n  \n  Upon initial violation in a MATCH, a FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. If the ALLIANCE ROBOT repeats the infraction\n  in the MATCH, a FOUL and a TECH FOUL are assessed against the violating\n  ALLIANCE. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that ROBOT in\n  that MATCH, the ROBOT has “earned” 2 FOULS and a TECH FOUL for their\n  ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH\n  FOUL, and for every 5 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a TECH\n  FOUL is assessed\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE and the REFEREE begins to count.\n  Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met,\n  and for each 5 seconds within that time, an additional TECH FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. A ROBOT in violation of this type of rule for\n  15 seconds receives a total of 4 TECH FOULS (assuming no other rules were\n  being simultaneously violated).\n  \n \n \n  \n  RED CARD for the\n  ALLIANCE\n  \n  \n  After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating ALLIANCE\n  with a RED CARD in the following fashion:\n  In a PLAYOFF MATCH, a single RED CARD is assessed to the ALLIANCE.\n  In all other scenarios, each team on the ALLIANCE is\n  issued a RED CARD.\n  \n \n\n\n 6.7      Head\nREFEREE and FTA Interaction The Head REFEREE has the ultimate authority in the ARENA\nduring the event, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game\nDesigners, FIRST personnel, FTA, and other event staff. The Head REFEREE\nrulings are final. No event staff, including the Head REFEREE, will review\nvideo, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any MATCH, from any source, under\nany circumstances. 6.7.1      Question\nBox Each ALLIANCE has a designated Question Box near the scoring\ntable. If a DRIVE TEAM has a question about a MATCH, the FIELD, etc., they may\nsend 1 DRIVE TEAM member to their corresponding Question Box. Depending on\ntiming, the Head REFEREE or FTA may postpone any requested discussion until the\nend of the subsequent MATCH. Technical questions regarding FIELD or ROBOT operation are\naddressed by the FTA, and additional team members are invited to participate in\nthese conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a\nruling or score, per Q101, 1 STUDENT from that DRIVE TEAM\nshould address the Head REFEREE after the ARENA Reset Signal (e.g. FIELD lights\nturn green). While FMS tracks quantities of FOULS, FIRST instructs\nREFEREES to not self-track details about FOULS and TECH FOULS; as a result, we\ndon’t expect REFEREES to recall details about what FOULS and TECH FOULS were\nmade, when they occurred, and against whom.","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144165\">6.3<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>Setup</a></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage GAME PIECES as\ndescribed in <a href=\"#_GAME_PIECES\">Section 6.3.4 GAME PIECES</a>.

Once this criterion is met, the HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button\nwhich AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that\nSPEAKER, whichever comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening\nto the sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal\nAMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER within 10\nseconds of the AMP button being pressed but haven’t yet been processed. An\nALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION\nends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered\nthrough the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do\nnot contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or <i>Coopertition</i> requirement,\nthey do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only “bank” up to 2\nNOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or <i>Cooperition</i>). </p><h3><a name=\"_Toc161144175\">6.5.4<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>SPOTLIGHTING</a></h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring <a name=\"SPOTLIGHT\">a\nHIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE</a>.

During AUTO, ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE\nTEAM control or input. ROBOTS attempt to score NOTES, exit their ROBOT STARTING\nZONE, and retrieve additional NOTES. There is a 3-second delay between AUTO and\nTELEOP for scoring purposes as described in Section 6.5\nScoring. The second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes\nand 15 seconds (2:15) and called the Teleoperated Period\n(TELEOP). During TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score NOTES\nand take their STAGE. 6.5     \nScoring  ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions\nthrough the course of a MATCH, including leaving their ROBOT STARTING ZONE,\nscoring NOTES in their SPEAKER and AMP, taking their STAGE, SPOTLIGHTING ONSTAGE\nROBOTS by scoring HIGH NOTES, cooperating with their opponents, and winning or\ntying MATCHES. Rewards are granted either via MATCH points, Coopertition\npoints, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, which\nincrease the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH,\nexcept as follows:  A.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 3 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO. B.    \nassessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 5 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP. C.     assessment\nof STAGE points is made 5 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following\nTELEOP, or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH,\nwhichever happens first. 6.5.1     \nNOTE Scoring Criteria A NOTE is scored in a SPEAKER once it passes through the FIELD-facing\nopening of the SPEAKER and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the AMP once it passes through the\nFIELD-facing opening of the AMP and through the sensor array. A NOTE is scored in the TRAP if it enters the TRAP from\nabove (i.e. through the cutout above the AprilTag). 6.5.2     \nROBOT Scoring Criteria To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS\nmust completely clear its ROBOT STARTING ZONE at any point during AUTO.  To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS must\nbe partially or completely contained in the STAGE ZONE at the end of the MATCH\n(more specifically, per criteria described in item\nC of Section 6.5 Scoring) and does not meet the criteria for ONSTAGE. To qualify for ONSTAGE points, a ROBOT may only be contacting: A.    \ntheir truss legs (pink shaded elements in Figure\n6‑3) via ROBOT BUMPERS, B.    \nGAME PIECES, C.    \nchain-facing vertical surfaces of their core or the nearest flap (with\nregards to the chain used by the ONSTAGE ROBOT, green shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), D.    \ncarpet-facing surfaces of their core (blue shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), and  E.    \na single STAGE chain (on their STAGE) (highlighted in orange in in Figure 6‑3),  F.    \nanother ROBOT qualified for ONSTAGE points,  G.    \na partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G424,\nand H.   \nan opponent ROBOT. Figure 6‑3 Contact points for ONSTAGE\nscoring eligibility  An ALLIANCE achieves HARMONY if more than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE\nvia direct or transitive support from a single chain. HARMONY points, as\nspecified in Table 6‑2 are awarded per additional ROBOT. 6.5.3      AMPLIFICATION AMPLIFICATION increases the number of\nMATCH points awarded for NOTES scored in a SPEAKER per Table\n6‑2. To AMPLIFY, an ALLIANCE must have at least 2 NOTES through their\nAMP. Once this criterion is met, the HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button\nwhich AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that\nSPEAKER, whichever comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening\nto the sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal\nAMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER within 10\nseconds of the AMP button being pressed but haven’t yet been processed. An\nALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION\nends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered\nthrough the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do\nnot contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or Coopertition requirement,\nthey do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only “bank” up to 2\nNOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or Cooperition).  6.5.4     \nSPOTLIGHTING ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring a\nHIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE. A HIGH NOTE is scored on the MICROPHONE if the\nNOTE surrounds, i.e. encircles, the MICROPHONE. Once a HIGH NOTE is scored on a\nMICROPHONE, ONSTAGE ROBOTS paired with (i.e. below) the MICROPHONE on which the\nHIGH NOTE was scored are awarded a greater number of points per Table 6‑2. 6.5.5     \nCoopertition Bonus If both ALLIANCES use a NOTE scored in their AMP to engage\nin Coopertition (by pressing their Coopertition button) within\nthe first 45 seconds of TELEOP (i.e. remaining MATCH time is greater than 1:30),\nall teams earn a Coopertition Bonus, and the threshold for the MELODY\ndecreases as described in Table 6‑2. A NOTE used for Coopertition is no longer eligible\nfor contribution to AMPLIFICATION. See Section 10.5.3\nQualification Ranking for more information about Coopertition influence\non Qualification Ranking order. In Playoff MATCHES, the Coopertition button is\nunused.  6.5.6     \nPoint Values Point values for tasks in CRESCENDO are detailed in Table 6‑2.

The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a\nRED CARD for egregious behavior inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics\nCompetition event. A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE\nholding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air while the Game Announcer describes\nthe violation. YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD\nis automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any\nsubsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including\nearning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is\nindicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air\nsimultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received\neither a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent\nMATCHES, except as noted below.  Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, its team number\nis presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning\nof all subsequent MATCHES, including any replays, as a reminder to the team,\nthe REFEREES, and the audience that they carry a YELLOW CARD. Figure 6‑4 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD\nindicators  All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of\nPractice, Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. Verbal warnings are\ncleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES through\nsubsequent tournament phases. The Head REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a verbal\nwarning or YELLOW CARD earned during Practice MATCHES through to Qualification\nMATCHES for particularly egregious behavior.  6.6.2     \nYELLOW and RED CARD application YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following: Table 6‑4 YELLOW and RED CARD application \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:\n   \n   \n   MATCH\n   to which CARD is applied:\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  prior to Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Practice MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH.\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of PRACTICE\n  MATCHES and the start of Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Qualification MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH.

The Head REFEREE\nrulings are final. No event staff, including the Head REFEREE, will review\nvideo, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any MATCH, from any source, under\nany circumstances. 6.7.1      Question\nBox Each ALLIANCE has a designated Question Box near the scoring\ntable. If a DRIVE TEAM has a question about a MATCH, the FIELD, etc., they may\nsend 1 DRIVE TEAM member to their corresponding Question Box. Depending on\ntiming, the Head REFEREE or FTA may postpone any requested discussion until the\nend of the subsequent MATCH. Technical questions regarding FIELD or ROBOT operation are\naddressed by the FTA, and additional team members are invited to participate in\nthese conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a\nruling or score, per Q101, 1 STUDENT from that DRIVE TEAM\nshould address the Head REFEREE after the ARENA Reset Signal (e.g. FIELD lights\nturn green). While FMS tracks quantities of FOULS, FIRST instructs\nREFEREES to not self-track details about FOULS and TECH FOULS; as a result, we\ndon’t expect REFEREES to recall details about what FOULS and TECH FOULS were\nmade, when they occurred, and against whom.","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144170\">6.4<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>MATCH Phases</a></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first phase of each MATCH is 15 seconds long and called\nthe Autonomous Period (AUTO).

An\nALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION\nends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered\nthrough the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do\nnot contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or <i>Coopertition</i> requirement,\nthey do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only “bank” up to 2\nNOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or <i>Cooperition</i>). </p><h3><a name=\"_Toc161144175\">6.5.4<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>SPOTLIGHTING</a></h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring <a name=\"SPOTLIGHT\">a\nHIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE</a>.

To qualify for ONSTAGE points, a ROBOT may only be contacting: A.    \ntheir truss legs (pink shaded elements in Figure\n6‑3) via ROBOT BUMPERS, B.    \nGAME PIECES, C.    \nchain-facing vertical surfaces of their core or the nearest flap (with\nregards to the chain used by the ONSTAGE ROBOT, green shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), D.    \ncarpet-facing surfaces of their core (blue shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), and  E.    \na single STAGE chain (on their STAGE) (highlighted in orange in in Figure 6‑3),  F.    \nanother ROBOT qualified for ONSTAGE points,  G.    \na partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G424,\nand H.   \nan opponent ROBOT. Figure 6‑3 Contact points for ONSTAGE\nscoring eligibility  An ALLIANCE achieves HARMONY if more than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE\nvia direct or transitive support from a single chain. HARMONY points, as\nspecified in Table 6‑2 are awarded per additional ROBOT. 6.5.3      AMPLIFICATION AMPLIFICATION increases the number of\nMATCH points awarded for NOTES scored in a SPEAKER per Table\n6‑2. To AMPLIFY, an ALLIANCE must have at least 2 NOTES through their\nAMP. Once this criterion is met, the HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button\nwhich AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that\nSPEAKER, whichever comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening\nto the sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal\nAMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER within 10\nseconds of the AMP button being pressed but haven’t yet been processed. An\nALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION\nends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered\nthrough the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do\nnot contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or Coopertition requirement,\nthey do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only “bank” up to 2\nNOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or Cooperition).  6.5.4     \nSPOTLIGHTING ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring a\nHIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE. A HIGH NOTE is scored on the MICROPHONE if the\nNOTE surrounds, i.e. encircles, the MICROPHONE. Once a HIGH NOTE is scored on a\nMICROPHONE, ONSTAGE ROBOTS paired with (i.e. below) the MICROPHONE on which the\nHIGH NOTE was scored are awarded a greater number of points per Table 6‑2. 6.5.5     \nCoopertition Bonus If both ALLIANCES use a NOTE scored in their AMP to engage\nin Coopertition (by pressing their Coopertition button) within\nthe first 45 seconds of TELEOP (i.e. remaining MATCH time is greater than 1:30),\nall teams earn a Coopertition Bonus, and the threshold for the MELODY\ndecreases as described in Table 6‑2. A NOTE used for Coopertition is no longer eligible\nfor contribution to AMPLIFICATION. See Section 10.5.3\nQualification Ranking for more information about Coopertition influence\non Qualification Ranking order. In Playoff MATCHES, the Coopertition button is\nunused.  6.5.6     \nPoint Values Point values for tasks in CRESCENDO are detailed in Table 6‑2.

The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a\nRED CARD for egregious behavior inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics\nCompetition event. A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE\nholding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air while the Game Announcer describes\nthe violation. YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD\nis automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any\nsubsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including\nearning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is\nindicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air\nsimultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received\neither a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent\nMATCHES, except as noted below.  Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, its team number\nis presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning\nof all subsequent MATCHES, including any replays, as a reminder to the team,\nthe REFEREES, and the audience that they carry a YELLOW CARD. Figure 6‑4 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD\nindicators  All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of\nPractice, Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. Verbal warnings are\ncleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES through\nsubsequent tournament phases. The Head REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a verbal\nwarning or YELLOW CARD earned during Practice MATCHES through to Qualification\nMATCHES for particularly egregious behavior.  6.6.2     \nYELLOW and RED CARD application YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following: Table 6‑4 YELLOW and RED CARD application \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:\n   \n   \n   MATCH\n   to which CARD is applied:\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  prior to Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Practice MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Practice MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH.\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of PRACTICE\n  MATCHES and the start of Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s first Qualification MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Qualification MATCHES\n  \n  \n  team’s current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH. In the case where the team participated as a SURROGATE\n  in the current (or just completed) MATCH, the card is applied to the team’s\n  previous MATCH (i.e. the team’s second Qualification MATCH)\n  \n \n \n  \n  between the end of\n  Qualification MATCHES and the start of Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S first Playoff MATCH\n  \n \n \n  \n  during the Playoff MATCHES\n  \n  \n  ALLIANCE’S current (or\n  just-completed) MATCH \n  \n \n\n\n 6.6.3     \nYELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to\nthe violating team’s entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team. If\nan ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD\nwhich results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES\nreceive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically,\nis DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH. 6.6.4      Violation\nDetails There are several styles of violation wording used in this\nmanual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the\nviolation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible\nviolations, but rather a representative set of combinations. Table 6‑5 Violation examples \n\n\n \n  \n   \n   Example\n   Violation\n   \n   \n   Expanded Interpretation\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH FOUL and YELLOW\n  CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is assessed against the\n  violating ALLIANCE. After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating\n  team with a YELLOW CARD.\n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL\n  per additional NOTE. If egregious, YELLOW CARD\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a number of FOULS\n  are assessed against the violating ALLIANCE equal to the number of additional\n  NOTES beyond the permitted quantity. Additionally, if the REFEREES determine\n  that the action was egregious, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team\n  with a YELLOW CARD after the MATCH. \n  \n \n \n  \n  FOUL, PLUS TECH\n  FOUL IF REPEATED\n  \n  \n  Upon initial violation in a MATCH, a FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. If the ALLIANCE ROBOT repeats the infraction\n  in the MATCH, a FOUL and a TECH FOUL are assessed against the violating\n  ALLIANCE. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that ROBOT in\n  that MATCH, the ROBOT has “earned” 2 FOULS and a TECH FOUL for their\n  ALLIANCE.\n  \n \n \n  \n  TECH\n  FOUL, and for every 5 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a TECH\n  FOUL is assessed\n  \n  \n  Upon violation, a TECH FOUL is\n  assessed against the violating ALLIANCE and the REFEREE begins to count.\n  Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met,\n  and for each 5 seconds within that time, an additional TECH FOUL is assessed\n  against the violating ALLIANCE. A ROBOT in violation of this type of rule for\n  15 seconds receives a total of 4 TECH FOULS (assuming no other rules were\n  being simultaneously violated).\n  \n \n \n  \n  RED CARD for the\n  ALLIANCE\n  \n  \n  After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating ALLIANCE\n  with a RED CARD in the following fashion:\n  In a PLAYOFF MATCH, a single RED CARD is assessed to the ALLIANCE.\n  In all other scenarios, each team on the ALLIANCE is\n  issued a RED CARD.\n  \n \n\n\n 6.7      Head\nREFEREE and FTA Interaction The Head REFEREE has the ultimate authority in the ARENA\nduring the event, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game\nDesigners, FIRST personnel, FTA, and other event staff. The Head REFEREE\nrulings are final. No event staff, including the Head REFEREE, will review\nvideo, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any MATCH, from any source, under\nany circumstances. 6.7.1      Question\nBox Each ALLIANCE has a designated Question Box near the scoring\ntable. If a DRIVE TEAM has a question about a MATCH, the FIELD, etc., they may\nsend 1 DRIVE TEAM member to their corresponding Question Box. Depending on\ntiming, the Head REFEREE or FTA may postpone any requested discussion until the\nend of the subsequent MATCH. Technical questions regarding FIELD or ROBOT operation are\naddressed by the FTA, and additional team members are invited to participate in\nthese conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a\nruling or score, per Q101, 1 STUDENT from that DRIVE TEAM\nshould address the Head REFEREE after the ARENA Reset Signal (e.g. FIELD lights\nturn green). While FMS tracks quantities of FOULS, FIRST instructs\nREFEREES to not self-track details about FOULS and TECH FOULS; as a result, we\ndon’t expect REFEREES to recall details about what FOULS and TECH FOULS were\nmade, when they occurred, and against whom.","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144171\"></a><a name=\"_ROBOTS\"></a><a name=\"_Scoring\"></a><a name=\"_YELLOW_and_RED\"></a>6.5<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>Scoring </h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions\nthrough the course of a MATCH, including leaving their ROBOT STARTING ZONE,\nscoring NOTES in their SPEAKER and AMP, taking their STAGE, SPOTLIGHTING ONSTAGE\nROBOTS by scoring HIGH NOTES, cooperating with their opponents, and winning or\ntying MATCHES.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rewards are granted either via MATCH points, <i>Coopertition</i>\npoints, or <a name=\"RP\">Ranking Points</a> (often abbreviated to RP, which\nincrease the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH,\nexcept as follows: </p><p class=\"Rule-LetteredListCxSpFirst\">A.<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>assessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 3 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO.</p><p class=\"Rule-LetteredListCxSpMiddle\">B.<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>assessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 5 seconds\nafter the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP.</p><p class=\"Rule-LetteredListCxSpLast\"><a name=\"RobotAssessment\"></a>C.<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Figure 10‑1 Sample MATCH schedule  10.2 \nMATCH Replays Over the course of the tournament, it may be necessary for a\nMATCH to be replayed. Typical causes for replays are MATCHES that end in a tie\nduring the Playoffs, MATCHES that are stopped because FIELD STAFF anticipated\nFIELD damage or personal injury, or if there is an ARENA FAULT. An ARENA FAULT\nis an error in ARENA operation that includes, but is\nnot limited to:  A.    \nbroken FIELD elements due to  a.     normal,\nexpected game play or  b.     ROBOT\nabuse of FIELD elements that affects the outcome of the MATCH for their\nopponents  B.    \npower failure to a portion of the FIELD (tripping the circuit breaker in\nthe DRIVER STATION is not considered a power failure), C.    \nimproper activation by the FMS,  D.    \nerrors by FIELD STAFF (except those listed in Section\n6.8 Other Logistics), and  E.    \na ROBOT radio disconnect that impairs operation of other ROBOTS on the\nFIELD for more than 8 seconds.  If, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, an ARENA FAULT\noccurs that affects the outcome of the MATCH and any team on the affected ALLIANCE\ndesires a replay, the MATCH will be replayed. FIRST Headquarters\nreserves the right to, with consultation of the Head REFEREE and the FTA,\nreplay a MATCH in which an ARENA FAULT impacts the outcome of an event. T201     \n*Replays will be the same. All\nreasonable effort is made to create the same conditions when replaying a MATCH\ncaused by an ARENA FAULT or FIELD damage. This means, for example, that a team\nthat was BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH which is to be replayed is BYPASSED\nfor the replay MATCH. ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM starting locations do not need to be\nreplicated when replaying a MATCH. Violation: MATCH with not start until the situation is\ncorrected 10.3 \nMeasurement At each event, the ARENA will be open for at least 30\nminutes prior to the start of Qualification MATCHES, during which time teams\nmay survey and/or measure the ARENA and bring ROBOTS on the FIELD to perform\nsensor calibration. The specific time that the FIELD is open will be\ncommunicated to teams at the event. Teams may bring specific questions or\ncomments to the FTA. T301     \n*Freeze, ROBOT. During the\nperiod when the ARENA is open for measurement, ROBOTS can be enabled, but may\nneither drive, extend outside their FRAME PERIMETER, nor interact with (e.g.\nscore, push, pickup, etc.) NOTES, the STAGE, SUBWOOFER, AMP, or other FIELD\nelements. Violation: Verbal warning, plus YELLOW CARD if subsequent\nviolations at any point during the event or egregious. 10.4  Practice MATCHES Practice MATCHES are played before Qualification MATCHES.\nThe Practice MATCH schedule is available as soon as possible, but no later than\nthe start of Practice MATCHES. For Regional events, it will also be published\nand available online at the FIRST\nRobotics Competition Event Results site, except during exceptional\ncircumstances. Practice MATCHES are randomly assigned, and teams may not switch\nscheduled Practice MATCHES. Each team is assigned an equal number of Practice MATCHES\nunless the number of teams multiplied by number of Practice MATCHES is not\ndivisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some teams to play an\nextra Practice MATCH. Practice MATCHES are not guaranteed at District Events due\nto event schedule constraints. 10.4.1  \nFiller Line A Filler Line is used to fill open slots at events that\nemploy scheduled Practice MATCHES or all slots at events with an open Practice MATCH\nschedule. Teams from the Filler Line are used on a first come, first served\nbasis to fill empty spots in Practice MATCHES left by other teams that do not\nreport to Queueing. The number of teams in the Filler Line is dependent upon\nspace at venues. Only teams that meet all criteria below qualify for the\nFiller Line: A.    \nROBOTS in the Filler Line must have passed inspection (this requirement\nmay be waived for events with open Practice MATCH schedules),  B.    \nDRIVE TEAMS must join the Filler Line with their ROBOT, C.    \nteams may not work on their ROBOT while in the Filler Line, D.    \nteams may not occupy more than 1 spot in the Filler Line, and E.    \nif a team is queued for their Practice MATCH, they may not also join the\nFiller Line. 10.5  Qualification MATCHES 10.5.1  \nSchedule The Qualification MATCH schedule is made available as soon\nas possible, but no later than 30 minutes before Qualification MATCHES are\nscheduled to begin. Teams receive 1 hard copy and it is also available at the FIRST Robotics Competition\nEvent Results site, except during exceptional circumstances. Each\nQualification schedule consists of a series of rounds in which each team plays\n1 MATCH per round. 10.5.2   MATCH Assignment FMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE partners for each\nQualification MATCH using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not switch\nQualification MATCH assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria,\nlisted in order of priority: 1.     ensure\neach team has at least the minimum required time between MATCHES (varies by\nevent size) 2.     minimize\nthe number of times a team is allied with any team 3.     minimize\nthe number of times a team plays opposite any team 4.     minimize\nthe use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to\nplay an extra Qualification MATCH) 5.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE 6.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION number At events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the\ncriteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of\ntimes a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even\ndistribution. All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES,\nequal to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number\nof MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some\nteams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those\nteams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH\nas a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third\nQualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team’s\nranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward\nto subsequent MATCHES. 10.5.3   Qualification Ranking Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE’S\nperformance in Qualification MATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each\neligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH per Table 6‑2. Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows: A.    \nA SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points. B.    \nA DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0\nRanking Points.  C.    \nA “no-show” team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for\nthat MATCH (see G208). A team is declared a no-show if no\nmember of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA at the start of the MATCH. The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team\nthroughout their Qualification MATCHES divided by the number of MATCHES they’ve\nbeen scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH), then truncated to 2 decimal\nplaces, is their Ranking Score (RS). All teams participating in Qualification MATCHES are ranked\nby Ranking Score. If the number of teams in attendance is ‘n’, they are ranked\n‘1’ through ‘n’, with ‘1’ being the team with the highest Ranking Score and ‘n’\nbeing the team with the lowest Ranking Score. Teams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria\ndefined in Table 10‑1.

In the\nPlayoffs, teams play on set ALLIANCES, chosen during ALLIANCE selection, and\nadvance through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking Points;\nthey advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE,\ncauses their alliance to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff MATCH. 10.6.1   ALLIANCE Selection\nProcess At the end of the Qualification MATCHES, the top 8 ranked\nteams become the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked ALLIANCES are designated, in order,\nALLIANCE 1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE selection\nprocess described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses 2 other teams to\njoin their ALLIANCE. T601     \n*Send a STUDENT representative.\nEach team must choose and send a STUDENT team representative to the ARENA at\nthe designated ALLIANCE Selection time (typically before the lunch break on the\nfinal day of the event) to represent their team. The\ndesignated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called the ALLIANCE\nCAPTAIN. This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff MATCHES. Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament The ALLIANCE selection process consists of 2 rounds during\nwhich each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team ranked below them in the standings\nto join their ALLIANCE. Round 1: In descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to ALLIANCE 8),\neach ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a single team to join their ALLIANCE. The invited\nteam’s representative steps forward and either accepts or declines the\ninvitation. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE.\nIf an invitation from a top 8 ALLIANCE to another ALLIANCE Lead is accepted,\nall lower ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot. The highest-ranked, unselected\nteam becomes the ALLIANCE 8 Lead. Round 2: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S\nsecond choice except the selection order is reversed, with ALLIANCE 8 picking\nfirst and ALLIANCE 1 picking last. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES of 3\nteams. T602     \n*Declining teams can’t be picked. An\nALLIANCE CAPTAIN may not invite a team that has declined another ALLIANCE’S\ninvitation to participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are\nineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make another selection An ALLIANCE Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE\nis able to invite teams to join their ALLIANCE but may not be invited to join\nanother ALLIANCE. At the conclusion of ALLIANCE selection, the highest ranked\nunselected teams are eligible to become a BACKUP TEAM, as defined in Section 10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS. 10.6.2  \nPlayoff MATCH Bracket The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and\nLower bracket as shown in Figure 10‑2. Each ALLIANCE begins with a slot\nin the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH in the Upper bracket, they\nremain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE loses a MATCH in the Upper bracket,\nthey transition to the Lower bracket.  ALLIANCES in the Lower bracket must win\nany subsequent MATCHES (except for finals) to remain in the tournament, i.e.\nonce they lose a MATCH, they’re out of the tournament. In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE is assigned to the\nred ALLIANCE. For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in Figure 10‑2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff\ntournament. Figure 10‑2 Playoff MATCH bracket (Red\nALLIANCE tops each pairing)  As shown in Figure 10‑2 and Table 10‑2, Playoff MATCHES\nconsist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and between Finals MATCHES.\nBreaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous MATCH. The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later. If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in Section 10.2 MATCH Replays, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.

The first ALLIANCE to win\n2 MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event’s Champions.  If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken\nusing the criteria in Table 10‑3, the MATCH remains a tie. In the case\nwhere an ALLIANCE hasn’t won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been played\n(because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals MATCHES,\ncalled Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the\ncase where the Overtime MATCH scores for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for\nthat Overtime MATCH is awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10‑3. 10.6.3  \nBACKUP TEAMS During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE may elect to replace\none of its ROBOTS due to a mechanical or software issue that prevents that ROBOT\nfrom competing effectively. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE\nTEAM replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES\nis called the BACKUP TEAM. In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to\nbring in the highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its ALLIANCE\nfor the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then composed of 4 teams. \n\n10.6.3.1   BACKUP\nTEAM Coupons\n\n Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the\nPlayoff MATCHES. If a second ROBOT from the ALLIANCE becomes inoperable, then\nthe ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1) ROBOTS. The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon\nunless it lists the number of the team whose ROBOT is being replaced and is\ninitialed by the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Once a BACKUP TEAM coupon is submitted and\naccepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be withdrawn by\nthe ALLIANCE. T603     \n*No BACKUP TEAM for replayed MATCHES.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM for a replayed MATCH. The sole\nexception is if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an ARENA\nFAULT that rendered an ALLIANCE’S ROBOT inoperable. Violation: The request is denied. T604     \n*No BACKUP TEAMS for 1st MATCH.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM until after their first Playoff MATCH. Violation: The request is denied. T605     \n*BACKUP TEAMS play when called.\nA BACKUP TEAM must be included in the LINEUP for the ALLIANCE’S next MATCH\nfollowing their recruitment. Violation: The LINEUP is denied. T606     \n*BACKUP TEAMS due 2 minutes before\nthe MATCH start time. The BACKUP TEAM Coupon must be submitted to the\nHead REFEREE (or their designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN not later than 2\nminutes before the expected MATCH start time in which the BACKUP TEAM is to\nplay.  Violation: The request is denied \n\n10.6.3.2   BACKUP\nPOOL\n\n After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick\nduring ALLIANCE Selection, REFEREES poll the remaining eligible teams. In rank\norder, REFEREES invite remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP\nPOOL, i.e. the group of teams willing and able to join an\nALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES, if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.\n T607     \n*Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM.\nA team must be present after ALLIANCE Selection to accept the REFEREE’S\ninvitation to join the BACKUP POOL. Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. T608     \n*Send a BACKUP TEAM Representative.\nThe top 2 ranked BACKUP TEAMS must send at least 1 STUDENT representative (and\noptionally 1 additional STUDENT or mentor) to a designated area near the FIELD\nfor the duration of the Playoff MATCHES.  These 2 representatives are available to\nanswer questions and accept invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE\nCAPTAINS. If 1 of these 2 teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves from\nthe BACKUP POOL, the next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL must provide\ntheir representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM has declined an invitation to join an ALLIANCE,\nit is no longer a member of the BACKUP POOL and ineligible to join another ALLIANCE. Violation: Verbal warning, plus the team is removed from\nBACKUP POOL if the situation cannot be corrected within a reasonable amount of\ntime. 10.6.4   LINEUPS Each ALLIANCE competing in a Playoff MATCH has the option to\nsubmit a LINEUP, which lists the 3 teams participating in the MATCH\nand their selected DRIVER STATIONS.  The LINEUP is kept confidential until the FIELD is set for\nthe MATCH at which point each ALLIANCE’S LINEUP appears on the Team Signs. \n\n10.6.4.1   LINEUPS\nfor 4-team ALLIANCES\n\n If an ALLIANCE has 4 members (either because a 3-team ALLIANCE\nhas called a BACKUP TEAM or the event is the FIRST Championship), a\nsingle representative from the team not on the LINEUP is allowed as a sixteenth\nALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team’s DRIVE TEAM. This additional\nrepresentative may only serve as a COACH.  \n\n10.6.4.2   Default\nLINEUP\n\n T609     \n*LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH.\nThe ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must submit their LINEUP in writing to the Head REFEREE (or\ntheir designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH start time. Violation: Late LINEUPS are denied, and the ALLIANCE’S most\nrecent LINEUP is applied. T610     \n*For replays, no changing LINEUPS\n(mostly). If a MATCH must be replayed due to an ARENA FAULT, the LINEUP\nfor the replayed MATCH is the same as the original MATCH. The sole exception is\nif, in the opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT rendered a ROBOT\ninoperable, in which case the LINEUP can be changed. Violation: The new LINEUP is denied. 10.6.5  \nPit Crews During the Playoff MATCHES and because of the distance\nbetween the FIELD and the pit area, extra team members may be needed to\nmaintain the ROBOT between MATCHES. Each team is permitted to have up to 3\nadditional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT repairs/maintenance. 10.6.6  \nSmall Event Exceptions The scheduling algorithm described in Section 10.5.2 MATCH Assignment works to minimize\nteams playing in back-to-back MATCHES. However, at events with fewer than 24\nteams, back-to-back plays may occur.  Multi-day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified\nPlayoff MATCH format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES, these events proceed through ALLIANCE\nSELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number of complete 3-team\nALLIANCES that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM (e.g. a\n24-team event creates 7 ALLIANCES, a 20-team event creates 6 ALLIANCES).   The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in Figure\n10‑2, with any matchup against a non-existent ALLIANCE resulting in a bye\n(i.e. automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE assigned a bye-MATCH\nis invited, though not required, to practice together in a null MATCH (i.e. it\nhas no bearing on the Playoff tournament) during the designated time in the\nPlayoff schedule. District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per Section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results)\nare awarded as if a full set of ALLIANCES was selected (i.e. the 2nd\nselection of the 3-seed ALLIANCE still receive 3 points regardless of how many ALLIANCES\nare formed).  <","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144210\"></a><a name=\"_MATCH_Schedules\"></a>10.1<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp; </span>MATCH Schedules</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A MATCH schedule is used to coordinate MATCHES at an Event.

Teams from the Filler Line are used on a first come, first served\nbasis to fill empty spots in Practice MATCHES left by other teams that do not\nreport to Queueing. The number of teams in the Filler Line is dependent upon\nspace at venues. Only teams that meet all criteria below qualify for the\nFiller Line: A.    \nROBOTS in the Filler Line must have passed inspection (this requirement\nmay be waived for events with open Practice MATCH schedules),  B.    \nDRIVE TEAMS must join the Filler Line with their ROBOT, C.    \nteams may not work on their ROBOT while in the Filler Line, D.    \nteams may not occupy more than 1 spot in the Filler Line, and E.    \nif a team is queued for their Practice MATCH, they may not also join the\nFiller Line. 10.5  Qualification MATCHES 10.5.1  \nSchedule The Qualification MATCH schedule is made available as soon\nas possible, but no later than 30 minutes before Qualification MATCHES are\nscheduled to begin. Teams receive 1 hard copy and it is also available at the FIRST Robotics Competition\nEvent Results site, except during exceptional circumstances. Each\nQualification schedule consists of a series of rounds in which each team plays\n1 MATCH per round. 10.5.2   MATCH Assignment FMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE partners for each\nQualification MATCH using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not switch\nQualification MATCH assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria,\nlisted in order of priority: 1.     ensure\neach team has at least the minimum required time between MATCHES (varies by\nevent size) 2.     minimize\nthe number of times a team is allied with any team 3.     minimize\nthe number of times a team plays opposite any team 4.     minimize\nthe use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to\nplay an extra Qualification MATCH) 5.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE 6.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION number At events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the\ncriteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of\ntimes a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even\ndistribution. All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES,\nequal to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number\nof MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some\nteams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those\nteams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH\nas a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third\nQualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team’s\nranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward\nto subsequent MATCHES. 10.5.3   Qualification Ranking Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE’S\nperformance in Qualification MATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each\neligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH per Table 6‑2. Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows: A.    \nA SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points. B.    \nA DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0\nRanking Points.  C.    \nA “no-show” team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for\nthat MATCH (see G208). A team is declared a no-show if no\nmember of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA at the start of the MATCH. The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team\nthroughout their Qualification MATCHES divided by the number of MATCHES they’ve\nbeen scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH), then truncated to 2 decimal\nplaces, is their Ranking Score (RS). All teams participating in Qualification MATCHES are ranked\nby Ranking Score. If the number of teams in attendance is ‘n’, they are ranked\n‘1’ through ‘n’, with ‘1’ being the team with the highest Ranking Score and ‘n’\nbeing the team with the lowest Ranking Score. Teams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria\ndefined in Table 10‑1.

In the\nPlayoffs, teams play on set ALLIANCES, chosen during ALLIANCE selection, and\nadvance through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking Points;\nthey advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE,\ncauses their alliance to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff MATCH. 10.6.1   ALLIANCE Selection\nProcess At the end of the Qualification MATCHES, the top 8 ranked\nteams become the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked ALLIANCES are designated, in order,\nALLIANCE 1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE selection\nprocess described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses 2 other teams to\njoin their ALLIANCE. T601     \n*Send a STUDENT representative.\nEach team must choose and send a STUDENT team representative to the ARENA at\nthe designated ALLIANCE Selection time (typically before the lunch break on the\nfinal day of the event) to represent their team. The\ndesignated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called the ALLIANCE\nCAPTAIN. This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff MATCHES. Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament The ALLIANCE selection process consists of 2 rounds during\nwhich each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team ranked below them in the standings\nto join their ALLIANCE. Round 1: In descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to ALLIANCE 8),\neach ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a single team to join their ALLIANCE. The invited\nteam’s representative steps forward and either accepts or declines the\ninvitation. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE.\nIf an invitation from a top 8 ALLIANCE to another ALLIANCE Lead is accepted,\nall lower ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot. The highest-ranked, unselected\nteam becomes the ALLIANCE 8 Lead. Round 2: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S\nsecond choice except the selection order is reversed, with ALLIANCE 8 picking\nfirst and ALLIANCE 1 picking last. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES of 3\nteams. T602     \n*Declining teams can’t be picked. An\nALLIANCE CAPTAIN may not invite a team that has declined another ALLIANCE’S\ninvitation to participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are\nineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make another selection An ALLIANCE Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE\nis able to invite teams to join their ALLIANCE but may not be invited to join\nanother ALLIANCE. At the conclusion of ALLIANCE selection, the highest ranked\nunselected teams are eligible to become a BACKUP TEAM, as defined in Section 10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS. 10.6.2  \nPlayoff MATCH Bracket The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and\nLower bracket as shown in Figure 10‑2. Each ALLIANCE begins with a slot\nin the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH in the Upper bracket, they\nremain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE loses a MATCH in the Upper bracket,\nthey transition to the Lower bracket.  ALLIANCES in the Lower bracket must win\nany subsequent MATCHES (except for finals) to remain in the tournament, i.e.\nonce they lose a MATCH, they’re out of the tournament. In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE is assigned to the\nred ALLIANCE. For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in Figure 10‑2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff\ntournament. Figure 10‑2 Playoff MATCH bracket (Red\nALLIANCE tops each pairing)  As shown in Figure 10‑2 and Table 10‑2, Playoff MATCHES\nconsist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and between Finals MATCHES.\nBreaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous MATCH. The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later. If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in Section 10.2 MATCH Replays, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.

The first ALLIANCE to win\n2 MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event’s Champions.  If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken\nusing the criteria in Table 10‑3, the MATCH remains a tie. In the case\nwhere an ALLIANCE hasn’t won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been played\n(because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals MATCHES,\ncalled Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the\ncase where the Overtime MATCH scores for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for\nthat Overtime MATCH is awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10‑3. 10.6.3  \nBACKUP TEAMS During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE may elect to replace\none of its ROBOTS due to a mechanical or software issue that prevents that ROBOT\nfrom competing effectively. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE\nTEAM replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES\nis called the BACKUP TEAM. In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to\nbring in the highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its ALLIANCE\nfor the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then composed of 4 teams. \n\n10.6.3.1   BACKUP\nTEAM Coupons\n\n Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the\nPlayoff MATCHES. If a second ROBOT from the ALLIANCE becomes inoperable, then\nthe ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1) ROBOTS. The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon\nunless it lists the number of the team whose ROBOT is being replaced and is\ninitialed by the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Once a BACKUP TEAM coupon is submitted and\naccepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be withdrawn by\nthe ALLIANCE. T603     \n*No BACKUP TEAM for replayed MATCHES.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM for a replayed MATCH. The sole\nexception is if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an ARENA\nFAULT that rendered an ALLIANCE’S ROBOT inoperable. Violation: The request is denied. T604     \n*No BACKUP TEAMS for 1st MATCH.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM until after their first Playoff MATCH. Violation: The request is denied. T605     \n*BACKUP TEAMS play when called.\nA BACKUP TEAM must be included in the LINEUP for the ALLIANCE’S next MATCH\nfollowing their recruitment. Violation: The LINEUP is denied. T606     \n*BACKUP TEAMS due 2 minutes before\nthe MATCH start time. The BACKUP TEAM Coupon must be submitted to the\nHead REFEREE (or their designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN not later than 2\nminutes before the expected MATCH start time in which the BACKUP TEAM is to\nplay.  Violation: The request is denied \n\n10.6.3.2   BACKUP\nPOOL\n\n After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick\nduring ALLIANCE Selection, REFEREES poll the remaining eligible teams. In rank\norder, REFEREES invite remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP\nPOOL, i.e. the group of teams willing and able to join an\nALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES, if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.\n T607     \n*Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM.\nA team must be present after ALLIANCE Selection to accept the REFEREE’S\ninvitation to join the BACKUP POOL. Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. T608     \n*Send a BACKUP TEAM Representative.\nThe top 2 ranked BACKUP TEAMS must send at least 1 STUDENT representative (and\noptionally 1 additional STUDENT or mentor) to a designated area near the FIELD\nfor the duration of the Playoff MATCHES.  These 2 representatives are available to\nanswer questions and accept invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE\nCAPTAINS. If 1 of these 2 teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves from\nthe BACKUP POOL, the next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL must provide\ntheir representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM has declined an invitation to join an ALLIANCE,\nit is no longer a member of the BACKUP POOL and ineligible to join another ALLIANCE. Violation: Verbal warning, plus the team is removed from\nBACKUP POOL if the situation cannot be corrected within a reasonable amount of\ntime. 10.6.4   LINEUPS Each ALLIANCE competing in a Playoff MATCH has the option to\nsubmit a LINEUP, which lists the 3 teams participating in the MATCH\nand their selected DRIVER STATIONS.  The LINEUP is kept confidential until the FIELD is set for\nthe MATCH at which point each ALLIANCE’S LINEUP appears on the Team Signs. \n\n10.6.4.1   LINEUPS\nfor 4-team ALLIANCES\n\n If an ALLIANCE has 4 members (either because a 3-team ALLIANCE\nhas called a BACKUP TEAM or the event is the FIRST Championship), a\nsingle representative from the team not on the LINEUP is allowed as a sixteenth\nALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team’s DRIVE TEAM. This additional\nrepresentative may only serve as a COACH.  \n\n10.6.4.2   Default\nLINEUP\n\n T609     \n*LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH.\nThe ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must submit their LINEUP in writing to the Head REFEREE (or\ntheir designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH start time. Violation: Late LINEUPS are denied, and the ALLIANCE’S most\nrecent LINEUP is applied. T610     \n*For replays, no changing LINEUPS\n(mostly). If a MATCH must be replayed due to an ARENA FAULT, the LINEUP\nfor the replayed MATCH is the same as the original MATCH. The sole exception is\nif, in the opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT rendered a ROBOT\ninoperable, in which case the LINEUP can be changed. Violation: The new LINEUP is denied. 10.6.5  \nPit Crews During the Playoff MATCHES and because of the distance\nbetween the FIELD and the pit area, extra team members may be needed to\nmaintain the ROBOT between MATCHES. Each team is permitted to have up to 3\nadditional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT repairs/maintenance. 10.6.6  \nSmall Event Exceptions The scheduling algorithm described in Section 10.5.2 MATCH Assignment works to minimize\nteams playing in back-to-back MATCHES. However, at events with fewer than 24\nteams, back-to-back plays may occur.  Multi-day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified\nPlayoff MATCH format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES, these events proceed through ALLIANCE\nSELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number of complete 3-team\nALLIANCES that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM (e.g. a\n24-team event creates 7 ALLIANCES, a 20-team event creates 6 ALLIANCES).   The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in Figure\n10‑2, with any matchup against a non-existent ALLIANCE resulting in a bye\n(i.e. automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE assigned a bye-MATCH\nis invited, though not required, to practice together in a null MATCH (i.e. it\nhas no bearing on the Playoff tournament) during the designated time in the\nPlayoff schedule. District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per Section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results)\nare awarded as if a full set of ALLIANCES was selected (i.e. the 2nd\nselection of the 3-seed ALLIANCE still receive 3 points regardless of how many ALLIANCES\nare formed).  <","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144211\"></a><a name=\"_Head_REFEREE_and\"></a><a name=\"_MATCH_Replays\"></a>10.2<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;\n</span>MATCH Replays</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Over the course of the tournament, it may be necessary for a\nMATCH to be replayed.

For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in Figure 10‑2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff\ntournament.</p><p class=\"MsoCaption\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;page-break-after:\navoid\"><a name=\"_Ref151397840\">Figure </a>10‑2 Playoff MATCH bracket (Red\nALLIANCE tops each pairing)</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"624\" height=\"358\" id=\"Picture 1153182459\" src=\"https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image060.png\" alt=\"P2143#yIS1\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">As shown in Figure 10‑2 and Table 10‑2, Playoff MATCHES\nconsist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and between Finals MATCHES.\nBreaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous MATCH. The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in <a href=\"#_Head_REFEREE_and\">Section 10.2 MATCH Replays</a>, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.</p><p class=\"MsoCaption\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;page-break-after:\navoid\"><a name=\"_Ref151397885\">Table

Violation: Verbal warning, plus YELLOW CARD if subsequent\nviolations at any point during the event or egregious. 10.4  Practice MATCHES Practice MATCHES are played before Qualification MATCHES.\nThe Practice MATCH schedule is available as soon as possible, but no later than\nthe start of Practice MATCHES. For Regional events, it will also be published\nand available online at the FIRST\nRobotics Competition Event Results site, except during exceptional\ncircumstances. Practice MATCHES are randomly assigned, and teams may not switch\nscheduled Practice MATCHES. Each team is assigned an equal number of Practice MATCHES\nunless the number of teams multiplied by number of Practice MATCHES is not\ndivisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some teams to play an\nextra Practice MATCH. Practice MATCHES are not guaranteed at District Events due\nto event schedule constraints. 10.4.1  \nFiller Line A Filler Line is used to fill open slots at events that\nemploy scheduled Practice MATCHES or all slots at events with an open Practice MATCH\nschedule. Teams from the Filler Line are used on a first come, first served\nbasis to fill empty spots in Practice MATCHES left by other teams that do not\nreport to Queueing. The number of teams in the Filler Line is dependent upon\nspace at venues. Only teams that meet all criteria below qualify for the\nFiller Line: A.    \nROBOTS in the Filler Line must have passed inspection (this requirement\nmay be waived for events with open Practice MATCH schedules),  B.    \nDRIVE TEAMS must join the Filler Line with their ROBOT, C.    \nteams may not work on their ROBOT while in the Filler Line, D.    \nteams may not occupy more than 1 spot in the Filler Line, and E.    \nif a team is queued for their Practice MATCH, they may not also join the\nFiller Line. 10.5  Qualification MATCHES 10.5.1  \nSchedule The Qualification MATCH schedule is made available as soon\nas possible, but no later than 30 minutes before Qualification MATCHES are\nscheduled to begin. Teams receive 1 hard copy and it is also available at the FIRST Robotics Competition\nEvent Results site, except during exceptional circumstances. Each\nQualification schedule consists of a series of rounds in which each team plays\n1 MATCH per round. 10.5.2   MATCH Assignment FMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE partners for each\nQualification MATCH using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not switch\nQualification MATCH assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria,\nlisted in order of priority: 1.     ensure\neach team has at least the minimum required time between MATCHES (varies by\nevent size) 2.     minimize\nthe number of times a team is allied with any team 3.     minimize\nthe number of times a team plays opposite any team 4.     minimize\nthe use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to\nplay an extra Qualification MATCH) 5.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE 6.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION number At events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the\ncriteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of\ntimes a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even\ndistribution. All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES,\nequal to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number\nof MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some\nteams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those\nteams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH\nas a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third\nQualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team’s\nranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward\nto subsequent MATCHES. 10.5.3   Qualification Ranking Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE’S\nperformance in Qualification MATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each\neligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH per Table 6‑2. Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows: A.    \nA SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points. B.    \nA DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0\nRanking Points.  C.    \nA “no-show” team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for\nthat MATCH (see G208). A team is declared a no-show if no\nmember of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA at the start of the MATCH. The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team\nthroughout their Qualification MATCHES divided by the number of MATCHES they’ve\nbeen scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH), then truncated to 2 decimal\nplaces, is their Ranking Score (RS). All teams participating in Qualification MATCHES are ranked\nby Ranking Score. If the number of teams in attendance is ‘n’, they are ranked\n‘1’ through ‘n’, with ‘1’ being the team with the highest Ranking Score and ‘n’\nbeing the team with the lowest Ranking Score. Teams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria\ndefined in Table 10‑1.

In the\nPlayoffs, teams play on set ALLIANCES, chosen during ALLIANCE selection, and\nadvance through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking Points;\nthey advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE,\ncauses their alliance to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff MATCH. 10.6.1   ALLIANCE Selection\nProcess At the end of the Qualification MATCHES, the top 8 ranked\nteams become the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked ALLIANCES are designated, in order,\nALLIANCE 1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE selection\nprocess described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses 2 other teams to\njoin their ALLIANCE. T601     \n*Send a STUDENT representative.\nEach team must choose and send a STUDENT team representative to the ARENA at\nthe designated ALLIANCE Selection time (typically before the lunch break on the\nfinal day of the event) to represent their team. The\ndesignated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called the ALLIANCE\nCAPTAIN. This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff MATCHES. Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament The ALLIANCE selection process consists of 2 rounds during\nwhich each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team ranked below them in the standings\nto join their ALLIANCE. Round 1: In descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to ALLIANCE 8),\neach ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a single team to join their ALLIANCE. The invited\nteam’s representative steps forward and either accepts or declines the\ninvitation. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE.\nIf an invitation from a top 8 ALLIANCE to another ALLIANCE Lead is accepted,\nall lower ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot. The highest-ranked, unselected\nteam becomes the ALLIANCE 8 Lead. Round 2: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S\nsecond choice except the selection order is reversed, with ALLIANCE 8 picking\nfirst and ALLIANCE 1 picking last. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES of 3\nteams. T602     \n*Declining teams can’t be picked. An\nALLIANCE CAPTAIN may not invite a team that has declined another ALLIANCE’S\ninvitation to participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are\nineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make another selection An ALLIANCE Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE\nis able to invite teams to join their ALLIANCE but may not be invited to join\nanother ALLIANCE. At the conclusion of ALLIANCE selection, the highest ranked\nunselected teams are eligible to become a BACKUP TEAM, as defined in Section 10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS. 10.6.2  \nPlayoff MATCH Bracket The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and\nLower bracket as shown in Figure 10‑2. Each ALLIANCE begins with a slot\nin the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH in the Upper bracket, they\nremain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE loses a MATCH in the Upper bracket,\nthey transition to the Lower bracket.  ALLIANCES in the Lower bracket must win\nany subsequent MATCHES (except for finals) to remain in the tournament, i.e.\nonce they lose a MATCH, they’re out of the tournament. In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE is assigned to the\nred ALLIANCE. For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in Figure 10‑2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff\ntournament. Figure 10‑2 Playoff MATCH bracket (Red\nALLIANCE tops each pairing)  As shown in Figure 10‑2 and Table 10‑2, Playoff MATCHES\nconsist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and between Finals MATCHES.\nBreaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous MATCH. The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later. If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in Section 10.2 MATCH Replays, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.

The first ALLIANCE to win\n2 MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event’s Champions.  If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken\nusing the criteria in Table 10‑3, the MATCH remains a tie. In the case\nwhere an ALLIANCE hasn’t won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been played\n(because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals MATCHES,\ncalled Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the\ncase where the Overtime MATCH scores for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for\nthat Overtime MATCH is awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10‑3. 10.6.3  \nBACKUP TEAMS During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE may elect to replace\none of its ROBOTS due to a mechanical or software issue that prevents that ROBOT\nfrom competing effectively. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE\nTEAM replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES\nis called the BACKUP TEAM. In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to\nbring in the highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its ALLIANCE\nfor the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then composed of 4 teams. \n\n10.6.3.1   BACKUP\nTEAM Coupons\n\n Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the\nPlayoff MATCHES. If a second ROBOT from the ALLIANCE becomes inoperable, then\nthe ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1) ROBOTS. The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon\nunless it lists the number of the team whose ROBOT is being replaced and is\ninitialed by the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Once a BACKUP TEAM coupon is submitted and\naccepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be withdrawn by\nthe ALLIANCE. T603     \n*No BACKUP TEAM for replayed MATCHES.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM for a replayed MATCH. The sole\nexception is if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an ARENA\nFAULT that rendered an ALLIANCE’S ROBOT inoperable. Violation: The request is denied. T604     \n*No BACKUP TEAMS for 1st MATCH.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM until after their first Playoff MATCH. Violation: The request is denied. T605     \n*BACKUP TEAMS play when called.\nA BACKUP TEAM must be included in the LINEUP for the ALLIANCE’S next MATCH\nfollowing their recruitment. Violation: The LINEUP is denied. T606     \n*BACKUP TEAMS due 2 minutes before\nthe MATCH start time. The BACKUP TEAM Coupon must be submitted to the\nHead REFEREE (or their designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN not later than 2\nminutes before the expected MATCH start time in which the BACKUP TEAM is to\nplay.  Violation: The request is denied \n\n10.6.3.2   BACKUP\nPOOL\n\n After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick\nduring ALLIANCE Selection, REFEREES poll the remaining eligible teams. In rank\norder, REFEREES invite remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP\nPOOL, i.e. the group of teams willing and able to join an\nALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES, if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.\n T607     \n*Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM.\nA team must be present after ALLIANCE Selection to accept the REFEREE’S\ninvitation to join the BACKUP POOL. Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. T608     \n*Send a BACKUP TEAM Representative.\nThe top 2 ranked BACKUP TEAMS must send at least 1 STUDENT representative (and\noptionally 1 additional STUDENT or mentor) to a designated area near the FIELD\nfor the duration of the Playoff MATCHES.  These 2 representatives are available to\nanswer questions and accept invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE\nCAPTAINS. If 1 of these 2 teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves from\nthe BACKUP POOL, the next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL must provide\ntheir representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM has declined an invitation to join an ALLIANCE,\nit is no longer a member of the BACKUP POOL and ineligible to join another ALLIANCE. Violation: Verbal warning, plus the team is removed from\nBACKUP POOL if the situation cannot be corrected within a reasonable amount of\ntime. 10.6.4   LINEUPS Each ALLIANCE competing in a Playoff MATCH has the option to\nsubmit a LINEUP, which lists the 3 teams participating in the MATCH\nand their selected DRIVER STATIONS.  The LINEUP is kept confidential until the FIELD is set for\nthe MATCH at which point each ALLIANCE’S LINEUP appears on the Team Signs. \n\n10.6.4.1   LINEUPS\nfor 4-team ALLIANCES\n\n If an ALLIANCE has 4 members (either because a 3-team ALLIANCE\nhas called a BACKUP TEAM or the event is the FIRST Championship), a\nsingle representative from the team not on the LINEUP is allowed as a sixteenth\nALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team’s DRIVE TEAM. This additional\nrepresentative may only serve as a COACH.  \n\n10.6.4.2   Default\nLINEUP\n\n T609     \n*LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH.\nThe ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must submit their LINEUP in writing to the Head REFEREE (or\ntheir designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH start time. Violation: Late LINEUPS are denied, and the ALLIANCE’S most\nrecent LINEUP is applied. T610     \n*For replays, no changing LINEUPS\n(mostly). If a MATCH must be replayed due to an ARENA FAULT, the LINEUP\nfor the replayed MATCH is the same as the original MATCH. The sole exception is\nif, in the opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT rendered a ROBOT\ninoperable, in which case the LINEUP can be changed. Violation: The new LINEUP is denied. 10.6.5  \nPit Crews During the Playoff MATCHES and because of the distance\nbetween the FIELD and the pit area, extra team members may be needed to\nmaintain the ROBOT between MATCHES. Each team is permitted to have up to 3\nadditional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT repairs/maintenance. 10.6.6  \nSmall Event Exceptions The scheduling algorithm described in Section 10.5.2 MATCH Assignment works to minimize\nteams playing in back-to-back MATCHES. However, at events with fewer than 24\nteams, back-to-back plays may occur.  Multi-day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified\nPlayoff MATCH format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES, these events proceed through ALLIANCE\nSELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number of complete 3-team\nALLIANCES that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM (e.g. a\n24-team event creates 7 ALLIANCES, a 20-team event creates 6 ALLIANCES).   The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in Figure\n10‑2, with any matchup against a non-existent ALLIANCE resulting in a bye\n(i.e. automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE assigned a bye-MATCH\nis invited, though not required, to practice together in a null MATCH (i.e. it\nhas no bearing on the Playoff tournament) during the designated time in the\nPlayoff schedule. District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per Section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results)\nare awarded as if a full set of ALLIANCES was selected (i.e. the 2nd\nselection of the 3-seed ALLIANCE still receive 3 points regardless of how many ALLIANCES\nare formed).  <","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144212\">10.3<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;\n</span>Measurement</a></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At each event, the ARENA will be open for at least 30\nminutes prior to the start of Qualification MATCHES, during which time teams\nmay survey and/or measure the ARENA and bring ROBOTS on the FIELD to perform\nsensor calibration.

All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES,\nequal to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number\nof MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some\nteams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those\nteams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH\nas a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third\nQualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team’s\nranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward\nto subsequent MATCHES. 10.5.3   Qualification Ranking Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE’S\nperformance in Qualification MATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each\neligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH per Table 6‑2. Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows: A.    \nA SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points. B.    \nA DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0\nRanking Points.  C.    \nA “no-show” team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for\nthat MATCH (see G208). A team is declared a no-show if no\nmember of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA at the start of the MATCH. The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team\nthroughout their Qualification MATCHES divided by the number of MATCHES they’ve\nbeen scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH), then truncated to 2 decimal\nplaces, is their Ranking Score (RS). All teams participating in Qualification MATCHES are ranked\nby Ranking Score. If the number of teams in attendance is ‘n’, they are ranked\n‘1’ through ‘n’, with ‘1’ being the team with the highest Ranking Score and ‘n’\nbeing the team with the lowest Ranking Score. Teams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria\ndefined in Table 10‑1.

In the\nPlayoffs, teams play on set ALLIANCES, chosen during ALLIANCE selection, and\nadvance through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking Points;\nthey advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE,\ncauses their alliance to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff MATCH. 10.6.1   ALLIANCE Selection\nProcess At the end of the Qualification MATCHES, the top 8 ranked\nteams become the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked ALLIANCES are designated, in order,\nALLIANCE 1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE selection\nprocess described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses 2 other teams to\njoin their ALLIANCE. T601     \n*Send a STUDENT representative.\nEach team must choose and send a STUDENT team representative to the ARENA at\nthe designated ALLIANCE Selection time (typically before the lunch break on the\nfinal day of the event) to represent their team. The\ndesignated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called the ALLIANCE\nCAPTAIN. This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff MATCHES. Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament The ALLIANCE selection process consists of 2 rounds during\nwhich each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team ranked below them in the standings\nto join their ALLIANCE. Round 1: In descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to ALLIANCE 8),\neach ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a single team to join their ALLIANCE. The invited\nteam’s representative steps forward and either accepts or declines the\ninvitation. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE.\nIf an invitation from a top 8 ALLIANCE to another ALLIANCE Lead is accepted,\nall lower ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot. The highest-ranked, unselected\nteam becomes the ALLIANCE 8 Lead. Round 2: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S\nsecond choice except the selection order is reversed, with ALLIANCE 8 picking\nfirst and ALLIANCE 1 picking last. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES of 3\nteams. T602     \n*Declining teams can’t be picked. An\nALLIANCE CAPTAIN may not invite a team that has declined another ALLIANCE’S\ninvitation to participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are\nineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make another selection An ALLIANCE Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE\nis able to invite teams to join their ALLIANCE but may not be invited to join\nanother ALLIANCE. At the conclusion of ALLIANCE selection, the highest ranked\nunselected teams are eligible to become a BACKUP TEAM, as defined in Section 10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS. 10.6.2  \nPlayoff MATCH Bracket The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and\nLower bracket as shown in Figure 10‑2. Each ALLIANCE begins with a slot\nin the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH in the Upper bracket, they\nremain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE loses a MATCH in the Upper bracket,\nthey transition to the Lower bracket.  ALLIANCES in the Lower bracket must win\nany subsequent MATCHES (except for finals) to remain in the tournament, i.e.\nonce they lose a MATCH, they’re out of the tournament. In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE is assigned to the\nred ALLIANCE. For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in Figure 10‑2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff\ntournament. Figure 10‑2 Playoff MATCH bracket (Red\nALLIANCE tops each pairing)  As shown in Figure 10‑2 and Table 10‑2, Playoff MATCHES\nconsist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and between Finals MATCHES.\nBreaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous MATCH. The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later. If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in Section 10.2 MATCH Replays, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.

The first ALLIANCE to win\n2 MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event’s Champions.  If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken\nusing the criteria in Table 10‑3, the MATCH remains a tie. In the case\nwhere an ALLIANCE hasn’t won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been played\n(because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals MATCHES,\ncalled Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the\ncase where the Overtime MATCH scores for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for\nthat Overtime MATCH is awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10‑3. 10.6.3  \nBACKUP TEAMS During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE may elect to replace\none of its ROBOTS due to a mechanical or software issue that prevents that ROBOT\nfrom competing effectively. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE\nTEAM replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES\nis called the BACKUP TEAM. In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to\nbring in the highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its ALLIANCE\nfor the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then composed of 4 teams. \n\n10.6.3.1   BACKUP\nTEAM Coupons\n\n Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the\nPlayoff MATCHES. If a second ROBOT from the ALLIANCE becomes inoperable, then\nthe ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1) ROBOTS. The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon\nunless it lists the number of the team whose ROBOT is being replaced and is\ninitialed by the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Once a BACKUP TEAM coupon is submitted and\naccepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be withdrawn by\nthe ALLIANCE. T603     \n*No BACKUP TEAM for replayed MATCHES.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM for a replayed MATCH. The sole\nexception is if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an ARENA\nFAULT that rendered an ALLIANCE’S ROBOT inoperable. Violation: The request is denied. T604     \n*No BACKUP TEAMS for 1st MATCH.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM until after their first Playoff MATCH. Violation: The request is denied. T605     \n*BACKUP TEAMS play when called.\nA BACKUP TEAM must be included in the LINEUP for the ALLIANCE’S next MATCH\nfollowing their recruitment. Violation: The LINEUP is denied. T606     \n*BACKUP TEAMS due 2 minutes before\nthe MATCH start time. The BACKUP TEAM Coupon must be submitted to the\nHead REFEREE (or their designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN not later than 2\nminutes before the expected MATCH start time in which the BACKUP TEAM is to\nplay.  Violation: The request is denied \n\n10.6.3.2   BACKUP\nPOOL\n\n After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick\nduring ALLIANCE Selection, REFEREES poll the remaining eligible teams. In rank\norder, REFEREES invite remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP\nPOOL, i.e. the group of teams willing and able to join an\nALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES, if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.\n T607     \n*Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM.\nA team must be present after ALLIANCE Selection to accept the REFEREE’S\ninvitation to join the BACKUP POOL. Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. T608     \n*Send a BACKUP TEAM Representative.\nThe top 2 ranked BACKUP TEAMS must send at least 1 STUDENT representative (and\noptionally 1 additional STUDENT or mentor) to a designated area near the FIELD\nfor the duration of the Playoff MATCHES.  These 2 representatives are available to\nanswer questions and accept invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE\nCAPTAINS. If 1 of these 2 teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves from\nthe BACKUP POOL, the next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL must provide\ntheir representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM has declined an invitation to join an ALLIANCE,\nit is no longer a member of the BACKUP POOL and ineligible to join another ALLIANCE. Violation: Verbal warning, plus the team is removed from\nBACKUP POOL if the situation cannot be corrected within a reasonable amount of\ntime. 10.6.4   LINEUPS Each ALLIANCE competing in a Playoff MATCH has the option to\nsubmit a LINEUP, which lists the 3 teams participating in the MATCH\nand their selected DRIVER STATIONS.  The LINEUP is kept confidential until the FIELD is set for\nthe MATCH at which point each ALLIANCE’S LINEUP appears on the Team Signs. \n\n10.6.4.1   LINEUPS\nfor 4-team ALLIANCES\n\n If an ALLIANCE has 4 members (either because a 3-team ALLIANCE\nhas called a BACKUP TEAM or the event is the FIRST Championship), a\nsingle representative from the team not on the LINEUP is allowed as a sixteenth\nALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team’s DRIVE TEAM. This additional\nrepresentative may only serve as a COACH.  \n\n10.6.4.2   Default\nLINEUP\n\n T609     \n*LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH.\nThe ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must submit their LINEUP in writing to the Head REFEREE (or\ntheir designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH start time. Violation: Late LINEUPS are denied, and the ALLIANCE’S most\nrecent LINEUP is applied. T610     \n*For replays, no changing LINEUPS\n(mostly). If a MATCH must be replayed due to an ARENA FAULT, the LINEUP\nfor the replayed MATCH is the same as the original MATCH. The sole exception is\nif, in the opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT rendered a ROBOT\ninoperable, in which case the LINEUP can be changed. Violation: The new LINEUP is denied. 10.6.5  \nPit Crews During the Playoff MATCHES and because of the distance\nbetween the FIELD and the pit area, extra team members may be needed to\nmaintain the ROBOT between MATCHES. Each team is permitted to have up to 3\nadditional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT repairs/maintenance. 10.6.6  \nSmall Event Exceptions The scheduling algorithm described in Section 10.5.2 MATCH Assignment works to minimize\nteams playing in back-to-back MATCHES. However, at events with fewer than 24\nteams, back-to-back plays may occur.  Multi-day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified\nPlayoff MATCH format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES, these events proceed through ALLIANCE\nSELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number of complete 3-team\nALLIANCES that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM (e.g. a\n24-team event creates 7 ALLIANCES, a 20-team event creates 6 ALLIANCES).   The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in Figure\n10‑2, with any matchup against a non-existent ALLIANCE resulting in a bye\n(i.e. automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE assigned a bye-MATCH\nis invited, though not required, to practice together in a null MATCH (i.e. it\nhas no bearing on the Playoff tournament) during the designated time in the\nPlayoff schedule. District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per Section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results)\nare awarded as if a full set of ALLIANCES was selected (i.e. the 2nd\nselection of the 3-seed ALLIANCE still receive 3 points regardless of how many ALLIANCES\nare formed).  <","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144213\"></a><a name=\"_Practice_MATCHES\"></a>10.4<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp; </span>Practice MATCHES</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Practice MATCHES are played before Qualification MATCHES.\nThe Practice MATCH schedule is available as soon as possible, but no later than\nthe start of Practice MATCHES.

Each\nQualification schedule consists of a series of rounds in which each team plays\n1 MATCH per round. 10.5.2   MATCH Assignment FMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE partners for each\nQualification MATCH using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not switch\nQualification MATCH assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria,\nlisted in order of priority: 1.     ensure\neach team has at least the minimum required time between MATCHES (varies by\nevent size) 2.     minimize\nthe number of times a team is allied with any team 3.     minimize\nthe number of times a team plays opposite any team 4.     minimize\nthe use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to\nplay an extra Qualification MATCH) 5.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE 6.     provide\neven distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION number At events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the\ncriteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of\ntimes a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even\ndistribution. All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES,\nequal to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number\nof MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some\nteams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those\nteams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH\nas a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third\nQualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team’s\nranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward\nto subsequent MATCHES. 10.5.3   Qualification Ranking Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE’S\nperformance in Qualification MATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each\neligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH per Table 6‑2. Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows: A.    \nA SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points. B.    \nA DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0\nRanking Points.  C.    \nA “no-show” team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for\nthat MATCH (see G208). A team is declared a no-show if no\nmember of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA at the start of the MATCH. The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team\nthroughout their Qualification MATCHES divided by the number of MATCHES they’ve\nbeen scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH), then truncated to 2 decimal\nplaces, is their Ranking Score (RS). All teams participating in Qualification MATCHES are ranked\nby Ranking Score. If the number of teams in attendance is ‘n’, they are ranked\n‘1’ through ‘n’, with ‘1’ being the team with the highest Ranking Score and ‘n’\nbeing the team with the lowest Ranking Score.

In the\nPlayoffs, teams play on set ALLIANCES, chosen during ALLIANCE selection, and\nadvance through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking Points;\nthey advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE,\ncauses their alliance to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff MATCH. 10.6.1   ALLIANCE Selection\nProcess At the end of the Qualification MATCHES, the top 8 ranked\nteams become the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked ALLIANCES are designated, in order,\nALLIANCE 1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE selection\nprocess described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses 2 other teams to\njoin their ALLIANCE. T601     \n*Send a STUDENT representative.\nEach team must choose and send a STUDENT team representative to the ARENA at\nthe designated ALLIANCE Selection time (typically before the lunch break on the\nfinal day of the event) to represent their team. The\ndesignated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called the ALLIANCE\nCAPTAIN. This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff MATCHES. Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament The ALLIANCE selection process consists of 2 rounds during\nwhich each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team ranked below them in the standings\nto join their ALLIANCE. Round 1: In descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to ALLIANCE 8),\neach ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a single team to join their ALLIANCE. The invited\nteam’s representative steps forward and either accepts or declines the\ninvitation. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE.\nIf an invitation from a top 8 ALLIANCE to another ALLIANCE Lead is accepted,\nall lower ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot. The highest-ranked, unselected\nteam becomes the ALLIANCE 8 Lead. Round 2: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S\nsecond choice except the selection order is reversed, with ALLIANCE 8 picking\nfirst and ALLIANCE 1 picking last. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES of 3\nteams. T602     \n*Declining teams can’t be picked. An\nALLIANCE CAPTAIN may not invite a team that has declined another ALLIANCE’S\ninvitation to participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are\nineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make another selection An ALLIANCE Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE\nis able to invite teams to join their ALLIANCE but may not be invited to join\nanother ALLIANCE. At the conclusion of ALLIANCE selection, the highest ranked\nunselected teams are eligible to become a BACKUP TEAM, as defined in Section 10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS. 10.6.2  \nPlayoff MATCH Bracket The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and\nLower bracket as shown in Figure 10‑2. Each ALLIANCE begins with a slot\nin the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH in the Upper bracket, they\nremain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE loses a MATCH in the Upper bracket,\nthey transition to the Lower bracket.  ALLIANCES in the Lower bracket must win\nany subsequent MATCHES (except for finals) to remain in the tournament, i.e.\nonce they lose a MATCH, they’re out of the tournament. In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE is assigned to the\nred ALLIANCE. For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in Figure 10‑2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff\ntournament. Figure 10‑2 Playoff MATCH bracket (Red\nALLIANCE tops each pairing)  As shown in Figure 10‑2 and Table 10‑2, Playoff MATCHES\nconsist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and between Finals MATCHES.\nBreaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous MATCH. The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later. If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in Section 10.2 MATCH Replays, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.

The first ALLIANCE to win\n2 MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event’s Champions.  If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken\nusing the criteria in Table 10‑3, the MATCH remains a tie. In the case\nwhere an ALLIANCE hasn’t won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been played\n(because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals MATCHES,\ncalled Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the\ncase where the Overtime MATCH scores for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for\nthat Overtime MATCH is awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10‑3. 10.6.3  \nBACKUP TEAMS During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE may elect to replace\none of its ROBOTS due to a mechanical or software issue that prevents that ROBOT\nfrom competing effectively. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE\nTEAM replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES\nis called the BACKUP TEAM. In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to\nbring in the highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its ALLIANCE\nfor the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then composed of 4 teams. \n\n10.6.3.1   BACKUP\nTEAM Coupons\n\n Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the\nPlayoff MATCHES. If a second ROBOT from the ALLIANCE becomes inoperable, then\nthe ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1) ROBOTS. The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon\nunless it lists the number of the team whose ROBOT is being replaced and is\ninitialed by the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Once a BACKUP TEAM coupon is submitted and\naccepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be withdrawn by\nthe ALLIANCE. T603     \n*No BACKUP TEAM for replayed MATCHES.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM for a replayed MATCH. The sole\nexception is if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an ARENA\nFAULT that rendered an ALLIANCE’S ROBOT inoperable. Violation: The request is denied. T604     \n*No BACKUP TEAMS for 1st MATCH.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM until after their first Playoff MATCH. Violation: The request is denied. T605     \n*BACKUP TEAMS play when called.\nA BACKUP TEAM must be included in the LINEUP for the ALLIANCE’S next MATCH\nfollowing their recruitment. Violation: The LINEUP is denied. T606     \n*BACKUP TEAMS due 2 minutes before\nthe MATCH start time. The BACKUP TEAM Coupon must be submitted to the\nHead REFEREE (or their designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN not later than 2\nminutes before the expected MATCH start time in which the BACKUP TEAM is to\nplay.  Violation: The request is denied \n\n10.6.3.2   BACKUP\nPOOL\n\n After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick\nduring ALLIANCE Selection, REFEREES poll the remaining eligible teams. In rank\norder, REFEREES invite remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP\nPOOL, i.e. the group of teams willing and able to join an\nALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES, if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.\n T607     \n*Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM.\nA team must be present after ALLIANCE Selection to accept the REFEREE’S\ninvitation to join the BACKUP POOL. Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. T608     \n*Send a BACKUP TEAM Representative.\nThe top 2 ranked BACKUP TEAMS must send at least 1 STUDENT representative (and\noptionally 1 additional STUDENT or mentor) to a designated area near the FIELD\nfor the duration of the Playoff MATCHES.  These 2 representatives are available to\nanswer questions and accept invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE\nCAPTAINS. If 1 of these 2 teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves from\nthe BACKUP POOL, the next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL must provide\ntheir representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM has declined an invitation to join an ALLIANCE,\nit is no longer a member of the BACKUP POOL and ineligible to join another ALLIANCE. Violation: Verbal warning, plus the team is removed from\nBACKUP POOL if the situation cannot be corrected within a reasonable amount of\ntime. 10.6.4   LINEUPS Each ALLIANCE competing in a Playoff MATCH has the option to\nsubmit a LINEUP, which lists the 3 teams participating in the MATCH\nand their selected DRIVER STATIONS.  The LINEUP is kept confidential until the FIELD is set for\nthe MATCH at which point each ALLIANCE’S LINEUP appears on the Team Signs. \n\n10.6.4.1   LINEUPS\nfor 4-team ALLIANCES\n\n If an ALLIANCE has 4 members (either because a 3-team ALLIANCE\nhas called a BACKUP TEAM or the event is the FIRST Championship), a\nsingle representative from the team not on the LINEUP is allowed as a sixteenth\nALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team’s DRIVE TEAM. This additional\nrepresentative may only serve as a COACH.  \n\n10.6.4.2   Default\nLINEUP\n\n T609     \n*LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH.\nThe ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must submit their LINEUP in writing to the Head REFEREE (or\ntheir designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH start time. Violation: Late LINEUPS are denied, and the ALLIANCE’S most\nrecent LINEUP is applied. T610     \n*For replays, no changing LINEUPS\n(mostly). If a MATCH must be replayed due to an ARENA FAULT, the LINEUP\nfor the replayed MATCH is the same as the original MATCH. The sole exception is\nif, in the opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT rendered a ROBOT\ninoperable, in which case the LINEUP can be changed. Violation: The new LINEUP is denied. 10.6.5  \nPit Crews During the Playoff MATCHES and because of the distance\nbetween the FIELD and the pit area, extra team members may be needed to\nmaintain the ROBOT between MATCHES. Each team is permitted to have up to 3\nadditional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT repairs/maintenance. 10.6.6  \nSmall Event Exceptions The scheduling algorithm described in Section 10.5.2 MATCH Assignment works to minimize\nteams playing in back-to-back MATCHES. However, at events with fewer than 24\nteams, back-to-back plays may occur.  Multi-day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified\nPlayoff MATCH format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES, these events proceed through ALLIANCE\nSELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number of complete 3-team\nALLIANCES that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM (e.g. a\n24-team event creates 7 ALLIANCES, a 20-team event creates 6 ALLIANCES).   The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in Figure\n10‑2, with any matchup against a non-existent ALLIANCE resulting in a bye\n(i.e. automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE assigned a bye-MATCH\nis invited, though not required, to practice together in a null MATCH (i.e. it\nhas no bearing on the Playoff tournament) during the designated time in the\nPlayoff schedule. District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per Section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results)\nare awarded as if a full set of ALLIANCES was selected (i.e. the 2nd\nselection of the 3-seed ALLIANCE still receive 3 points regardless of how many ALLIANCES\nare formed).  <","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144215\"></a><a name=\"_Qualification_MATCHES\"></a>10.5<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp; </span>Qualification MATCHES</h2><h3><a name=\"_Toc161144216\">10.5.1<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>Schedule</a></h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Qualification MATCH schedule is made available as soon\nas possible, but no later than 30 minutes before Qualification MATCHES are\nscheduled to begin.

If a team plays a MATCH\nas a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third\nQualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team’s\nranking.

The invited\nteam’s representative steps forward and either accepts or declines the\ninvitation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE.\nIf an invitation from a top 8 ALLIANCE to another ALLIANCE Lead is accepted,\nall lower ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot. The highest-ranked, unselected\nteam becomes the ALLIANCE 8 Lead.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Round 2: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S\nsecond choice except the selection order is reversed, with ALLIANCE 8 picking\nfirst and ALLIANCE 1 picking last.

In the\nPlayoffs, teams play on set ALLIANCES, chosen during ALLIANCE selection, and\nadvance through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking Points;\nthey advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE,\ncauses their alliance to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff MATCH. 10.6.1   ALLIANCE Selection\nProcess At the end of the Qualification MATCHES, the top 8 ranked\nteams become the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked ALLIANCES are designated, in order,\nALLIANCE 1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE selection\nprocess described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses 2 other teams to\njoin their ALLIANCE. T601     \n*Send a STUDENT representative.\nEach team must choose and send a STUDENT team representative to the ARENA at\nthe designated ALLIANCE Selection time (typically before the lunch break on the\nfinal day of the event) to represent their team. The\ndesignated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called the ALLIANCE\nCAPTAIN. This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff MATCHES. Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament The ALLIANCE selection process consists of 2 rounds during\nwhich each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team ranked below them in the standings\nto join their ALLIANCE. Round 1: In descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to ALLIANCE 8),\neach ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a single team to join their ALLIANCE. The invited\nteam’s representative steps forward and either accepts or declines the\ninvitation. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE.\nIf an invitation from a top 8 ALLIANCE to another ALLIANCE Lead is accepted,\nall lower ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot. The highest-ranked, unselected\nteam becomes the ALLIANCE 8 Lead. Round 2: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S\nsecond choice except the selection order is reversed, with ALLIANCE 8 picking\nfirst and ALLIANCE 1 picking last. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES of 3\nteams. T602     \n*Declining teams can’t be picked. An\nALLIANCE CAPTAIN may not invite a team that has declined another ALLIANCE’S\ninvitation to participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are\nineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make another selection An ALLIANCE Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE\nis able to invite teams to join their ALLIANCE but may not be invited to join\nanother ALLIANCE. At the conclusion of ALLIANCE selection, the highest ranked\nunselected teams are eligible to become a BACKUP TEAM, as defined in Section 10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS. 10.6.2  \nPlayoff MATCH Bracket The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and\nLower bracket as shown in Figure 10‑2. Each ALLIANCE begins with a slot\nin the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH in the Upper bracket, they\nremain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE loses a MATCH in the Upper bracket,\nthey transition to the Lower bracket.  ALLIANCES in the Lower bracket must win\nany subsequent MATCHES (except for finals) to remain in the tournament, i.e.\nonce they lose a MATCH, they’re out of the tournament. In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE is assigned to the\nred ALLIANCE. For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in Figure 10‑2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff\ntournament. Figure 10‑2 Playoff MATCH bracket (Red\nALLIANCE tops each pairing)  As shown in Figure 10‑2 and Table 10‑2, Playoff MATCHES\nconsist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and between Finals MATCHES.\nBreaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous MATCH. The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later. If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in Section 10.2 MATCH Replays, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.

The first ALLIANCE to win\n2 MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event’s Champions.  If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken\nusing the criteria in Table 10‑3, the MATCH remains a tie. In the case\nwhere an ALLIANCE hasn’t won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been played\n(because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals MATCHES,\ncalled Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the\ncase where the Overtime MATCH scores for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for\nthat Overtime MATCH is awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10‑3. 10.6.3  \nBACKUP TEAMS During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE may elect to replace\none of its ROBOTS due to a mechanical or software issue that prevents that ROBOT\nfrom competing effectively. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE\nTEAM replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES\nis called the BACKUP TEAM. In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to\nbring in the highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its ALLIANCE\nfor the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then composed of 4 teams. \n\n10.6.3.1   BACKUP\nTEAM Coupons\n\n Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the\nPlayoff MATCHES. If a second ROBOT from the ALLIANCE becomes inoperable, then\nthe ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1) ROBOTS. The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon\nunless it lists the number of the team whose ROBOT is being replaced and is\ninitialed by the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Once a BACKUP TEAM coupon is submitted and\naccepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be withdrawn by\nthe ALLIANCE. T603     \n*No BACKUP TEAM for replayed MATCHES.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM for a replayed MATCH. The sole\nexception is if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an ARENA\nFAULT that rendered an ALLIANCE’S ROBOT inoperable. Violation: The request is denied. T604     \n*No BACKUP TEAMS for 1st MATCH.\nAn ALLIANCE may not request a BACKUP TEAM until after their first Playoff MATCH. Violation: The request is denied. T605     \n*BACKUP TEAMS play when called.\nA BACKUP TEAM must be included in the LINEUP for the ALLIANCE’S next MATCH\nfollowing their recruitment. Violation: The LINEUP is denied. T606     \n*BACKUP TEAMS due 2 minutes before\nthe MATCH start time. The BACKUP TEAM Coupon must be submitted to the\nHead REFEREE (or their designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN not later than 2\nminutes before the expected MATCH start time in which the BACKUP TEAM is to\nplay.  Violation: The request is denied \n\n10.6.3.2   BACKUP\nPOOL\n\n After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick\nduring ALLIANCE Selection, REFEREES poll the remaining eligible teams. In rank\norder, REFEREES invite remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP\nPOOL, i.e. the group of teams willing and able to join an\nALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES, if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.\n T607     \n*Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM.\nA team must be present after ALLIANCE Selection to accept the REFEREE’S\ninvitation to join the BACKUP POOL. Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM. T608     \n*Send a BACKUP TEAM Representative.\nThe top 2 ranked BACKUP TEAMS must send at least 1 STUDENT representative (and\noptionally 1 additional STUDENT or mentor) to a designated area near the FIELD\nfor the duration of the Playoff MATCHES.  These 2 representatives are available to\nanswer questions and accept invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE\nCAPTAINS. If 1 of these 2 teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves from\nthe BACKUP POOL, the next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL must provide\ntheir representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM has declined an invitation to join an ALLIANCE,\nit is no longer a member of the BACKUP POOL and ineligible to join another ALLIANCE. Violation: Verbal warning, plus the team is removed from\nBACKUP POOL if the situation cannot be corrected within a reasonable amount of\ntime. 10.6.4   LINEUPS Each ALLIANCE competing in a Playoff MATCH has the option to\nsubmit a LINEUP, which lists the 3 teams participating in the MATCH\nand their selected DRIVER STATIONS.  The LINEUP is kept confidential until the FIELD is set for\nthe MATCH at which point each ALLIANCE’S LINEUP appears on the Team Signs. \n\n10.6.4.1   LINEUPS\nfor 4-team ALLIANCES\n\n If an ALLIANCE has 4 members (either because a 3-team ALLIANCE\nhas called a BACKUP TEAM or the event is the FIRST Championship), a\nsingle representative from the team not on the LINEUP is allowed as a sixteenth\nALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team’s DRIVE TEAM. This additional\nrepresentative may only serve as a COACH.  \n\n10.6.4.2   Default\nLINEUP\n\n T609     \n*LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH.\nThe ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must submit their LINEUP in writing to the Head REFEREE (or\ntheir designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH start time. Violation: Late LINEUPS are denied, and the ALLIANCE’S most\nrecent LINEUP is applied. T610     \n*For replays, no changing LINEUPS\n(mostly). If a MATCH must be replayed due to an ARENA FAULT, the LINEUP\nfor the replayed MATCH is the same as the original MATCH. The sole exception is\nif, in the opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT rendered a ROBOT\ninoperable, in which case the LINEUP can be changed. Violation: The new LINEUP is denied. 10.6.5  \nPit Crews During the Playoff MATCHES and because of the distance\nbetween the FIELD and the pit area, extra team members may be needed to\nmaintain the ROBOT between MATCHES. Each team is permitted to have up to 3\nadditional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT repairs/maintenance. 10.6.6  \nSmall Event Exceptions The scheduling algorithm described in Section 10.5.2 MATCH Assignment works to minimize\nteams playing in back-to-back MATCHES. However, at events with fewer than 24\nteams, back-to-back plays may occur.  Multi-day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified\nPlayoff MATCH format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES, these events proceed through ALLIANCE\nSELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number of complete 3-team\nALLIANCES that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM (e.g. a\n24-team event creates 7 ALLIANCES, a 20-team event creates 6 ALLIANCES).   The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in Figure\n10‑2, with any matchup against a non-existent ALLIANCE resulting in a bye\n(i.e. automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE assigned a bye-MATCH\nis invited, though not required, to practice together in a null MATCH (i.e. it\nhas no bearing on the Playoff tournament) during the designated time in the\nPlayoff schedule. District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per Section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results)\nare awarded as if a full set of ALLIANCES was selected (i.e. the 2nd\nselection of the 3-seed ALLIANCE still receive 3 points regardless of how many ALLIANCES\nare formed).  <","text":"<h2><a name=\"_Toc161144219\"></a><a name=\"_Playoff_MATCHES\"></a>10.6<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp; </span>Playoff MATCHES</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Playoff MATCHES follow the qualification MATCHES.

The Blue\nand Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S MATCHES.\nThe expected start time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH\nschedule or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH,\nwhichever is later.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in <a href=\"#_Head_REFEREE_and\">Section 10.2 MATCH Replays</a>, teams are notified of\nwhen the replay will occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to\nreset their ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The\naffected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.</p><p class=\"MsoCaption\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;page-break-after:\navoid\"><a name=\"_Ref151397885\">Table

Announcements on the\nFIELD and in the pits also provide information on delays, and any team\nuncertain of when to queue for a MATCH should communicate with queuing\nvolunteers.\n\nDuring Qualification MATCHES, the expected start time of\nthe MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH schedule or the cycle time for\ncurrent round minus 3 minutes from the end of the previous MATCH (which is\nreflected on the schedule on the Pit Display), whichever is later.\n\nDuring Playoff MATCHES, the expected start time of the\nMATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH schedule or 15 minutes from either\nALLIANCE’S previous MATCH, whichever is later.\n\n B.    \nThe DRIVE TEAM has access to the FIELD and is neither MATCH ready nor\nmaking a good faith effort, as perceived by the Head REFEREE, to quickly become\nMATCH ready. \n\nTeams that have violated G208 or have 1\nDRIVE TEAM member present and have informed event staff that their ROBOT will\nnot be participating in the MATCH are considered MATCH ready and not in\nviolation of this rule.\n\n Violation: If a Qualification MATCH, verbal warning, or if a\nsubsequent violation within the tournament phase, TECH FOUL applied to their\nupcoming MATCH. If the DRIVE TEAM is not MATCH ready within 2 minutes of the\nverbal warning/TECH FOUL and the Head REFEREE perceives no good faith effort by\nthe DRIVE TEAM to quickly become MATCH ready, DISABLED. If a Playoff MATCH,\nverbal warning issued the ALLIANCE, or if an ALLIANCE’S subsequent violation\nwithin the tournament phase, TECH FOUL applied to their upcoming MATCH. If the\nALLIANCE is not MATCH ready within 2 minutes of the verbal warning having been\nissued to all 3 teams/TECH FOUL and the Head REFEREE perceives no good faith\neffort by the DRIVE TEAM to quickly become MATCH ready, their ROBOT is\nDISABLED. \n\nThe intent of this rule is to provide an equitable amount\nof time for both ALLIANCES to prepare for each MATCH and give DRIVE TEAMS grace\ngiven extenuating circumstances that cause them to be late. \n\nOnce a verbal warning/TECH FOUL is issued, the Head REFEREE\nstarts a 2-minute timer and makes a good faith effort to share the timer’s\nstatus with the delaying DRIVE TEAM. \n\nBeing “MATCH ready” requires that the ROBOT is on the\nFIELD, in its STARTING CONFIGURATION, and turned on. Additionally, the DRIVE\nTEAM members must be in their starting positions.\n\nIn general, good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH\nready are entirely for the purposes of transitioning the ROBOT into a MATCH\nready state (i.e. not attempts to significantly alter a ROBOT’s capabilities.)\nExamples of good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH ready include but are\nnot limited to:\n\nA.     walking safely towards the FIELD with a ROBOT that a team\nis not actively modifying,\n\nB.     applying quick fixes such as tape or cable ties to make the\nROBOT compliant with STARTING CONFIGURATION requirements,\n\nC.     waiting for an OPERATOR CONSOLE computer to boot, and \n\nD.     working with FIELD STAFF to get the ROBOT connected to the\nFIELD.\n\nExamples that are not considered good faith efforts to\nquickly become MATCH ready include but are not limited to:\n\nE.     a ROBOT not moving to the FIELD, \n\nF.     a ROBOT moving to the FIELD but being actively modified\nwhile doing so, \n\nG.     a DRIVE TEAM member remaining on the FIELD once a MATCH is\nready to begin (indicated by the green LEDs having turned off), \n\nH.    installing BUMPERS, charging pneumatic systems, or any\nother ROBOT maintenance not considered a quick fix as described in item B above\nonce on the FIELD, \n\nI.       time-consuming use of alignment devices that are external\nto the ROBOT (e.g. a DRIVE TEAM could bring and use a measuring tape, as long\nas there is no delay to the MATCH by doing so), and\n\nJ.     repairs more substantial than those described in B. \n\nThere are no rules that prohibit use of hand tools\n(including battery operated tools) while setting up ROBOTS from the FIELD,\nprovided they do not cause significant delay or cause safety concerns.\n\n"},"G302":{"name":"G302","type":"rule","text":"<p class=\"RuleNumber-Game\"><a name=\"G302\"></a><b><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\">G302<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><span class=\"Headline-Evergreen\">*You can’t bring/use anything you want. </span>The\nonly equipment that may be brought to the ARENA for a MATCH is listed below.

If a\nROBOT not compliant with part C participates, its team receives a RED CARD. 7.4     \nIn-MATCH Rules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH\nbegins.  7.4.1     \nAUTO The AUTO period is the first 15 seconds of the\nMATCH, and the FMS blocks any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS operate with only their\npre-programmed instructions.

For example, if a ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only\nmove extremely slowly, the ROBOT is considered unable to drive.\n\n"},"G419":{"name":"G419","type":"rule","text":"<p class=\"RuleNumber-Game\"><a name=\"_Ref148105312\"></a><a name=\"G419\"></a><b><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\">G419<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span></span></b><span class=\"Headline-Evergreen\">*Don’t tip or entangle.</span>\nA ROBOT may not deliberately, as perceived by a REFEREE, attach to, tip, or\nentangle with an opponent ROBOT. </p><p class=\"Violation\">Violation: TECH FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if CONTINUOUS or\nopponent ROBOT is unable to drive, then TECH FOUL and RED CARD. </p><div style=\"border:solid #6CBEDC 1.5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;\nbackground:#C5E5F1;margin-left:1.0in;margin-right:1.0in\">\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\"><span style=\"color:black\">Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited\nto:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox-letteredlist\" style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;\nmargin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\">A.<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=\"color:black\">using a wedge-like MECHANISM to tip over opponent ROBOTS,</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox-letteredlist\" style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;\nmargin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\">B.<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=\"color:black\">making BUMPER-to-BUMPER contact with an opponent ROBOT that\nis attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them to\nfall over again, and </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox-letteredlist\" style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;\nmargin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\">C.<span style=\"font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=\"color:black\">causing an opponent ROBOT to tip over by contacting the\nROBOT after it starts to tip if, in the judgement of the REFEREE, that contact\ncould have been avoided.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\"><span style=\"color:black\">Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal ROBOT to\nROBOT interaction, including single BUMPER to BUMPER hits that result in a\nROBOT tipping, as perceived by the REFEREE, is not a violation of this rule.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"BlueBox\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:#C5E5F1\"><span style=\"color:black\">\"Unable to drive\" means that because of the\nincident, the DRIVER can no longer drive to a desired location in a reasonable\ntime (generally).

Drawing large amounts of\ncurrent from many motors at the same time could lead to drops in ROBOT battery\nvoltage that may result in tripping the main breaker or trigger the brownout\nprotection of the roboRIO. For more information about the roboRIO brownout\nprotection and measuring current draw using the PDP/PDH, see roboRIO\nBrownout and Understanding Current Draw.\n\nAndyMark PG Gearmotors are sold with labeling based on the\nentire assembly.
